title: Chapter 19&#58;The Transformation of the Value (and Respectively the Price) of Labour-Power into Wages — Detailed Commentary

Transition
----------

We have seen that the production of surplus-value is accomplished by
implementing a certain time relation in production: the time the worker works is
longer than the time that is needed to produce the value of her
labour-power. This is the secret of the production of surplus-value and the
efficiency of this production is expressed in the rate of surplus-value
$m/v$. Since the production of surplus-value is the purpose of the capitalist
production process, the worker is hired - her labour-power is bought - in order
to squeeze a certain amount of surplus living labour out of her, i.e. to put her
to work long enough to realise a surplus-value: $m$. We shall see that the wage
is the form in which the purchase of labour power and the purpose of this
purchase are consolidated. Put differently, the form of payment expresses the
truth that necessary labour is conditioned on surplus labour under the rule of
capital, not the other way around.

Price of Labour
---------------

> 675:1 On the surface of bourgeois society, the compensation of the laborer
> appears as price of labor, a certain amount of money paid for a certain amount
> of labor. People speak of the value of labor, and call its expression in money
> the necessary or nat ural price of labor. On the other hand they speak of
> market prices of labor, i.e. prices which oscillate above or below this
> necessary price. [^1]

The form in which the worker is paid the value of her labour-power is the wage:
payment for labour instead of labour-power: living labour is paid, not the
capacity to work. This is as if you would not buy the icecream, which has the
capacity to fill you up, but the filling-up-your-tummy. You are not buying the
object but the useful effect of that object when consumed.

We already established in Chapter 6 that it is labour-power not labour
which is bought and sold:

> 270:1 In order to extract value out of the consumption of a commodity, our
> friend the money-owner must be lucky enough to find within the sphere of
> circulation, on the market, a commodity whose use-value possesses the peculiar
> property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption is therefore
> itself an objectification of labour, hence a creation of value. The possessor
> of money does find such a special commodity on the market: the capacity for
> labour, in other words labour-power.

But here we encounter that the sale and purchase of this commodity appears
differently. However, false consciousness is not the main point of this chapter,
the form of payment is real. Capital pays for labour: say 12 hours or a certain
amount per produced commodity. This *is* the predominant form in which capitalists
pay for labour.

Appearance
----------

First, we investigate the appearance as such. If payment is made conditional on
a certain amount of labour being expended this does not imply that this amount
of labour - performance - is what is being paid.

How much value, which we measure in a certain amount of congealed abstract
labour, is in 12 hours of (abstract) labour. You could say: well, 12. Which
doesn't account for anything, just states again that we are talking about 12
hours. As such, it cannot be an adequate account of what's going on. This is
apt, as it is not labour which is actually sold.

> 675:3 In any case, if labor were to be sold as a commodity in the market, it
> would have to exist before being sold. But if the worker were able to endow it
> with an independent existence, he would be selling a commodity, and not labor.
 
This echoes a point made earlier (in Chapter 6):

> 272: The second essential condition which allows the owner of money to find
> labour-power in the market as a commodity is this, that the possessor of
> labour-power, instead of being able to sell commodities in which labour has
> been objectified, must rather be compelled to offer for sale as a commodity
> that very labour-power which exists onlu in his living body ... If products
> are produced as commodities, they must be sold after they have been produced,
> and they can only satisfy the producer's needs after they have been sold.

The independent existence of labour is in its product, this is how labour
actualises itself. If labour could be sold independently, i.e. as a commodity,
the worker would: she'd get the value of the product not only her labour-power's
value. It is not this tautology - 12 hours of abstract labour produce 12 hours
worth of value - which is being expressed. Instead, "value of labour" is
supposed to account for the wage earned by a worker.

> 676:1 Even if one disregards these contradictions, a direct exchange of money,
> i.e. of objectified labor, with living labor, would either supersede the law

The second point - we maintain the law of value so no capital could exist -
argued first:

> Either equivalents are exchanged, and then the worker receives \\$1.44 for 12
> hours of labor; the price of his labor would be equal to the price of his

> and that his labor is wage labor.

If the worker receives the value-product of her labour - there would be no value
left for the capitalist.

> Or else he receives, in return for 12 hours of labor, less than \\$1.44,
> i.e. less than 12 hours of labor. 12 hours of labor are exchanged for 10, 6,
> etc. hours of labor. By equating unequal quantities in this way, one does not

12 hours are equivalent to 10 hours, which are equivalent to 8 1/3 hours, which
are equivalent to about 7 hours … etc until its equivalent to nothing at
all. So we'd arrive at the conclusion that 12 hours are nothing. But perhaps the
form of what is being exchanged does the trick?

One might argue that the aggregate state of labour - liquid or solid, so to
speak - is what makes all the difference. But the point of value is that it
doesn't count how much labour *was* expended on producing a certain commodity,
but how much *is* necessary. As such, the distinction living vs. dead or liquid
vs. congealed is void.

Assuming that what is sold is labour is hence a non-starter, it is a
contradiction and not an account of what is happening. We already established in
Chapter 6 that what is actually sold is labour-power not labour. The form of
payment being bound to performance does not imply performance is actually paid:

> 677:1 That which comes directly face to face with the money owner on the
> market, is in fact not labor, but the laborer. What the latter sells is his
> labor-power. As soon as his labor begins, it has already ceased to belong to
> him; it can therefore no longer be sold by him. Labor is the substance, the
> immanent measure of value, but has itself no value.

Hence, not only does value of labour attribute value to something which does not
value - say the potatoes from your backyard - but something which cannot have
value, it is a completely imaginary expression:

> 677:2 In the expression ‘value of labor’, the concept of value is not only
> altogether extinguished, but it is turned into its opposite. It is an
> imaginary expression, like, say, ‘value of the earth’.
 
So far for the critique of the from as *false* appearance, but the wage for is
real not merely ideology.

> relations of production themselves. They are categories for the forms of
> appearance of essential relations. That in their appearance things often

It is not enough to show the irrationality of this form, but we must also
understand why the essence appears in this form. Why does capital pay for
labour-power in the form of payment for labour? That this irrational expression
isn't a mere issue of people thinking nonsense is alluded to in the footnote
where Proudhon is critiqued for not understanding the grim reality of labour as
a commodity.
