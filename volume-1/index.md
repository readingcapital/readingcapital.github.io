## Part One: Commodities and Money ##

### Chapter 1: [The Commodity](chapter-01-commentary) ###

The object of the critique of political economy is the systematic development of
what the wealth is in a capitalist societies — the elementary form in which this
wealth appears is the commodity.

#### The Two Factors of the Commodity: Use-Value and Value ####

A commodity is a thing that is *produced for exchange*. It is use-value and
value.

It is *use-value* because it has the physical properties to satisfy human
needs. As a use-value it is particular and different from other things.

It is *value* as a bit of social wealth as such which is exchangeable against
any other commodity. Different commodities are equated, not in only theory but
in practice.  The expression of this general quality to be exchangeable as a bit
of social wealth expresses itself as exchangeability against a particular other
commodity. This expression of value is *exchange value*.

A commodity is value because human labour is needed to produce it which then is
used as lever to gain access other products of labour.

#### The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities ####

What counts is not that labour produced a particular useful thing – *concrete
labour* – but that labour is effort. Labour is reduced to *abstract labour*. The
*substance of value* is congealed abstract human labour.

Labour is measured in time and value is measured in labour-time. Any commodity
counts only as a representative of all commodities of a certain kind due to
generalised exchange. The *magnitude of value* is not individual labour-time,
but *socially necessary labour-time*.

Commodity production presupposes a *division of labour* and develops it. But the
division of labour does not presuppose commodity production.

For it to take full effect that the magnitude of value is socially necessary
labour-time, it is presupposed that producers switch branches of industry when
this allows them to get more value for their products. Some branches of industry
are not that easy to switch into, they are to some extent exempt from the law of
value: in these branches of industry *complicated labour* is performed (as
opposed to *simple labour*). The labour there counts as multiplied labour of
other branches of industry.

The *productivity of labour* measures how many use-values per labour time are
produced; it is a determination of concrete labour. Increasing productivity on a
social level has no effect on the amount of value produced in, say, one
hour. Instead, the same value is distributed over more products. However, since
socially necessary labour-time determines value, any commodity producer
producing faster than average stands to gain: she can demand the equivalent of,
say, 1 hour worth of abstract labour for, say, ½ labour-time actually expended
(assuming simple labour). On the one hand, more labour means more value. On the
other hand, less labour relative to other producers means more value per labour
time expended.


#### The Value-Form, or Exchange-Value ####

Value is a quality of the commodity, but it is a social quality: power of access
to social wealth. Before this quality can be activated it must be
expressed. Commodities must express their value-being – they are not only
themselves but a claim to social wealth. They must express this in a way which
is unified, so that they all make the same claim towards each other.

They express this by declaring one commodity to be value pure and simple and by
declaring themselves to be equal to that commodity: *money*. This also means
that they deny their own immediate value being and they have to proof that they
are indeed money-equal. In their attempt to express their own value-being,
commodities confront themselves with money which immediately counts as value.

#### The Fetishism of the Commodity and Its Secret ####

While people collectively bring about the social relations of commodity
production and exchange, they are not aware of this, they do not do this
consciously — insofar as they are only interested in their practical success in
this economy.  Rather, the social relations of their labours appear to them as
relations of things and they relate to these objective forms.  In the price of
commodities producers see how much social wealth their own labour commands.  The
latter fact does not appear directly, but indirectly in the relation between
commodities. In this society the social relations of labour of producers is
expressed as *social relations between their products*. Their own products of
labour confront them as having power over them, but this is an expression of
their own social relations: *fetish*. This does not follow from the division of
labour but from the particular mode of production: private production for
exchange.

### Chapter 2: [The Process of Exchange](chapter-02-commentary) ###

Commodity owners relate to each other through their objects and are subject to
the economic laws governing their commodities.  They are determined as
*character masks* of their commodities.

The process of exchange presupposes that the exchangers respect each others
*private property* and each other as proprietors of this property. They must
acknowledge each other as free and equal *persons* – a status guaranteed by the
state.  Their power over each other is only the power of their commodities.

Commodity owners cannot cooperatively agree on a money as for each of them their
own commodities count as immediately value and other commodities as particular
use-values. The state fixes a money.

### Chapter 3: [Money, or the Circulation of Commodities](chapter-03-commentary) ###

#### The Measure of Values ####

In the price form a commodity claims to be money equal.  This is the first
function of the money commodity: to stand in ideally so that commodities can
express their value – they are not only some particular concrete material wealth
but also a part of and claim to total social wealth.  The money commodity acts
as *measure of value* because it is value.  It acts as the *standard of
prices* because it as a use-value can be measured and subdivided (length,
volume, weight).  No real money has to be at hand for a commodity to express its
value in a price. However, the *price* form is a claim of a commodity to be
value by being money equal. All commodities must prove they are as good as
money, they must — at any cost: *deviation of price from value* — become
money. The purpose of a commodity is to exchange for money.

Because money now counts as the ultimate and immediate economic power, anything
becomes available for sale, regardless of whether it has value or not.

#### The Means of Circulation ####

To be consumed a commodity must first be sold.  Firstly, the body of a commodity
is only useful in the hands of someone else (production for exchange). Secondly,
the producer can only consume it, after it has been exchanged for money and back
into a commodity.  For a commodity to be sold it must not only meet demand but
demand backed by money.  A commodity must perform the change of form
commodity-money-commodity: *$C-M-C$*.  The metamorphosis of a commodity splits
into two parts which are separate but belong together: *selling* and
*buying*. This constitutes the abstract possibility of crisis.

Selling is the point when a commodity proves that it is value.  It is the
commodity's "salto mortale" as the commodity either lands on its feet (realises
its value) or dies (is thrown away).

A commodity drops out of circulation when it is consumed.  Money, on the
other hand, does not drop out: circulation of money.  In this circulation money
is always only a fleeing moment, the point is not to hold on to, but to pass it
on to complete the metamorphosis with $M-C$.  In this function money can be
replaced by a *symbol of value*: a coin.

#### Money ####

So far all money functions did not require actual money to be involved.  With
money as money it is not sufficient any more to be only ideally present (measure
of value) or to be represented by a symbol (means of circulation). Actual
*money* is required.

The first act of circulation – $C-M$ – is the hard part, money is the ultimate
means to gain access to anything in society, everything else is such only
provisionally, in a society where producers deny each other the means to satisfy
their needs. The desire and need arises for money. The *hoarder* satisfies this
need by sale without purchase — sale to aquire money.  Qualitatively, money is
exchangable for anything and not limited, but quantitatively any sum of money is
limited; the hoarder's drive for money is boundless.  Sale without purchase
means that the hoarder pursues her interest by not engaging in consumption, she
becomes richer by denying herself consumption – she does not really get
richer. Money's power is to access social wealth on the market, but the hoarder
withholds it from circulation.

The present absence of money ought not to hinder business. Commodity owners may
replace actual payment of money with promises of payment (which again may
circulate).  The money used to pay out such a promise of payment is a *means of
payment*: it does not circulate commodities but satisfies a demand of payment.
In the end only very little actual money may change hands because opposing
demands may cancel each other out.  However, when the process does not run
smoothly (crisis), hard cash is demanded.

On the world market where money represents truly abstract wealth and where money
is *world money* actual gold is required to settle accounts.  No coin or promise
suffices.

## Part Two: [The Transformation of Money into Capital](chapter-03-04-transition) ##

### Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital ###

The form of simple commodity circulation is $C-M-C$. The form of *capital* is
money-commodity-money ($M-C-M$): value is the expressed purpose. This form would
be a mere tautology if $M$ at the beginning was the same as at the end. The only
sensible movement is *$M-C-M'$* money becoming more money, value generating
surplus-value. Still, the beginning and the end is the same: money. This was not
the case with $C-M-C$ where the first and last commodity were different.  In
itself $M-C-M'$ has no limit and is endless.  The bearer of the movement
$M-C-M'$ is a *capitalist* and $M-C-M'$ the *general formula of capital*.

### Chapter 5: Contradictions in the General Formula ###

$M-C-M'$ seems to fly in the face of the laws of commodity exchange where equal
exchanges for equal. $M' = M + m$ cannot come from circulation.  At the same
time, a commodity producer can produce value on her own, but she cannot produce
surplus-value $m$. That is, if $M$ is ought to be reason for $M'$ then this
reason cannot be separated from circulation.

### Chapter 6: The Sale and Purchase of Labour-Power ###

The apparent contradiction is resolved by the purchase of a special commodity:
*labour-power*. Labour-power, the ability to work, can be bought on the
market. The value of this commodity is determined by the amount of
socially-necessary labour to reproduce it, like for other commodities.  However,
unlike other commodities the standard of reproduction of proletarians, and
therewith the value of labour-power, is flexible and established in society
("moral element"), e.g. through class struggle. Once labour-power is bought it
can made to produce more value than is needed to reproduce it.  The use-value of
labour-power is that it can create value. The riddle of surplus-value is
solved. A money owner must find *free workers* on the market. Free in a double
sense: free to sell their labour-power and free from the means of production
which compels them to sell their labour-power.

Capital is hence confronted with the determinations of the labour process.

## Part Three: The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value ##

### Chapter 7: [The Labour Process and the Valorization Process](chapter-07-commentary) ###

Labour is the purposeful interaction with nature.  The *labour process* uses
tools and material. It applies the laws of nature (physics etc.) to accomplish
its purpose. Tools and material are consumed in the production process. These
are the conditions dictated to capital and cannot change. Under the rule of
capital there are two modifications: command of the capitalist and separation of
the product of labour from the immediate producer. Under the rule of capital
labour is a moment of capital in production.

The labour process only exists under the rule of capital if it is also
*valorisation process*. Production must result in commodities which contain more
value than was expended on production.  The value of those commodities is a
combination of the value of the means of production used up during their
production and the new value created by labour during production.

> 304:1 The production process, considered as the unity of the labour process
> and the process of creating value, is the process of production of
> commodities; considered as the unity of the labour process and the process of
> valorization, it is the capitalist process of production, or the capitalist
> form of the production of commodities.

### Chapter 8: [Constant Capital and Variable Capital](chapter-08-commentary) ###

The moments of the labour process differ in how they appear in the valorisation
process.

The means of production (tools and material) are *constant capital*: $c$. They
do not create new value. They are not variable but constant magnitudes as their
value is simply transferred. How? The concrete side of labour transforms
material into a finished product and transfers its value. It is a gratis service
of labour that it transfers and therewith preserves value.

Labour-power once it is bought by capital is *variable capital*: $v$.  The
amount of value it produces is variable and not dependent on its value
itself. Its value is not transferred but reproduced. It is the part of capital
that produces surplus-value.

### Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus-Value ###

The movement $M-C-M'$ depends on the expansion that $v$ can accomplish. The
*rate of surplus-value* is the effectiveness of variable capital in producing a
surplus. It is given by surplus-value/variable-capital = $s/v$. Constant capital
$c$ does not influence the amount of surplus-value $s$, except to provide the
necessary conditions. Increasing the ratio $s/v$ is not the standpoint of
capitalists. But the rate of surplus-value expresses the source of surplus-value
and its effectiveness.

The time during which the worker only produces an equivalent of the value of her
labour-power is called *necessary labour-time*. The time during which she
produces surplus-value is called *surplus labour-time*. The rate of
surplus-value also expresses the rate of exploitation of labour-power and is
equally expressed as (surplus labour-time)/(necessary labour-time).  The sum of
necessary labour-time and surplus labour-time is the absolute extent of
labour-time, i.e. the working day.

### Chapter 10: The Working Day ###

The rate of surplus-value is expressed by the ratio of surplus labour-time to
necessary labour-time. For a given necessary labour-time capital can improve the
ratio by extending the *working day*. The working day is not a fixed quantity,
only necessary labour-time is — for now — fixed. The working day is bounded
above by a *physical limit* when workers cannot be sufficiently reproduced to do
their job and by class struggle (*"moral obstacles"*).  Capital demands to
maximise the utilisation of the commodity it purchased, workers demand that they
can use their commodity — labour-power — as a means of living. From the laws of
commodity exchange no given extent of the working day follows.

Through class struggle the state is informed that capital's hunger for surplus
labour is destroying the basis of its own valorisation. The state intervenes and
establishes a *normal working day* — a normal standard of exploitation. This
restriction on exploitation in the interest of its continuation must be enforced
against capital. The state also reflects that this restriction is for capital by
allowing exceptions.

Capital not only has an interest in extending the working day per worker but
also in keeping production going all night and day. The preservation and
utilisation of constant capital is here the main incentive: the *shift system*.

### Chapter 11: The Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value ###

1. The *mass of surplus-value* $S$ is given by $S = V · s/v$ where $s$ is the
   surplus-value supplied by a single worker per day, $v$ is the value of her
   labour-power and $V$ is the total expenditure on variable capital.  As
   $s'=s/v$ and $V$ determine the mass of surplus-value, a drop in one can be
   compensated by an increase in the other.

2. However, the absolute length of the day — i.e. that it only has 24 hours —
   puts a limit on compensating a reduction of variable capital by an increased
   rate of surplus-value.

3. The mass of surplus-value produced by different capitals — if the value of
   labour-power is given and the rate of exploitation constant — differs
   directly as their outlay in variable capital $V$.

This means that the amount of workers employed (resp. in society) represents a
limit for surplus-value $S$ for a given capital (resp. overall).

## Part Four: The Production of Relative Surplus-Value ##

### Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value ###

Improving the rate of surplus-value by lengthening the working day is the
production of *absolute surplus-value*. The production of absolute surplus-value
has its limits in the length of the day and the amount of workers employed or in
society.

If the length of the working day is constant, then the rate of surplus-value can
only be improved by shortening necessary labour-time. This is the production of
*relative surplus-value*.

Necessary labour-time is shortened by improving the productivity of labour in
those branches of industry for those products which (eventually) end up as
necessary means of subsistence for workers. If the necessary means of
subsistence can be produced more cheaply, necessary labour-time drops. Capital
uses its command over the labour process to restructure it with the effect of a
reduction in necessary labour-time.

This result is attained not by a conscious plan by capitalists to reduce
necessary labour-time on a social level but by their attempts to increase the
productivity of labour in their own factories. Since socially necessary
labour-time determines value, anyone producing faster than average stands to
gain extra. For them individually the ration $s/v$ is improved. This is an
incentive for capitalists to increase productivity. Eventually competitors will
catch up or perish. In any case, the result is that the new level of
productivity becomes generalised and the value of the produced products
drops. If these products belong to the necessary means of subsistence, then this
reduces the value of labour-power — improving the ratio $s/v$ in general.

The purpose of reducing the required time to produce a given item is not to save
labour-time, but to save necessary labour-time in order to increase surplus
labour-time. Labour saving technologies do not result in a reduction of
work.

### Chapter 13: Co-operation ###

It is a condition for capital that it employs several workers at the same
time. This allows for the first method of relative surplus-value production:
*cooperation*.

1. Employing many workers emancipates capital from the limitations of individual
   workers and — if a certain size is reached — their difference average out.

2. Employing many workers allows for a more economic use of constant capital
   $c$, less outlay to put the same amount of workers in motion.  Reducing
   outlay in $c$ might also reduce the value of labour-power if we are
   considering branches of industries whose products somehow enter the means of
   subsistence for workers.  Economy of constant capital is picked up again
   Volume 3.

3. Capital can also exploit gains in productivity which result from social
   labour and cooperation: more people work and can accomplish more, they
   educate each other, they motivate each other.

Capitalist cooperation is not mere cooperation as required by the use-value
being produced, say, a pyramid which can only be produced by many people.
Instead, capital employs cooperation as a general technique to improve the
productivity of labour.

The benefits of cooperation entail a certain size of capital which is bigger
than the formal minimal capital based on mere absolute surplus-value production.
A certain number of workers is needed and these workers need a certain amount of
means of production.

The workers who cooperate are not the subjects of their cooperation. It is only
capital which brings them together and impose cooperation on them.  Capital must
supervise this cooperation and assert it against individual workers.  This
requires a new strata of workers who exercise this control and supervision.

Cooperation is the logically first method of production of relative
surplus-value, all other methods rely on cooperation.

### Chapter 14: [The Division of Labour and Manufacture](chapter-14-commentary) ###

Capital transcends its dependency on the quality of labour-powers working
independently side-by-side by restructuring their activity in accordance with
their function. Their activities become proper partial operations in
*manufacture*.

The specialisation attained in manufacture allow capital to reshape labour
processes and tools.

1. Specialisation improves performance but at the same time is monotonous for
   the worker.  Productivity increases to the detriment of the *specialised
   worker*.

2. Tools are specialised in accordance with their new narrower task.
   Productivity increases through monotonous specialisation becomes a quality of
   the tools.

The various degrees of skill required produce a *division of labour in
manufacture* and with it a hierarchy of jobs. At the same time a category of
unskilled labour is produced, which allows to reduce $v$. In any case: less
training costs and qualification required by simplification and narrowing of
labour.

Manufacture increases the minimal size required for capital as its methods
require a certain size to be applied.

In the first step the worker had to sell her labour-power because she lacked the
means of production. Now, she has to sell her labour-power because her labour is
so narrowed and emptied that it could not be usefully expended except as part of
social production process which — in this society — capital brings together.

Yet, in manufacture capital remains dependent on the skill of its
workers. However, manufacture creates the technical basis for large scale
machinery which overcomes this obstacle.

### Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry ###

#### The Development of Machinery ####

With the use of *big machinery* capital emancipates itself from the limits of
individual skill and the human body.  Tools are revolutionised and turn into a
modern system of machinery where human "hands" only support it.  The conditions
and form of labour is dictated to the worker by the objective existence in the
machinery. The tool dictates the worker how to work — the machine applies the
worker.

The machine replaces the worker who operates single tools, replacement of human
body strength by the application of forces of nature.

The purpose of this operation is not a more pleasant production process or more
free time due to increases in productivity. The purpose is to reduce necessary
labour-time in order to increase surplus labour-time.

#### The Value Transferred by the Machinery to the Product ####

The results of science cost nothing once they are attained.  But to use them the
appropriate means of production are required. Their value increases the value of
the product because their value is transferred.  Yet, the purpose is to make
these products cheaper. The individual machine might cost more, so the minimal
size of capital increases.  However, because the machine is more productive its
value spreads across more products.  There is less $c$ contribution for each
individual product.

Furthermore, as the productivity of making machines increases their value
drops, they become cheaper.

The part of value which is transferred from the means of production to the final
product increases relatively to $v$ but drops absolutely (the product becomes
cheaper).

Machinery is only employed to replace living necessary labour. It is only
worthwhile to capital when it is cheaper to buy the machine than to pay
workers. The conditions for applying labour saving techniques are narrower than
in a mode of production where production is for use-values.  A machine is not
used if it only saves labour absolutely, but only when it saves $v$.

#### The Most Immediate Effects of Machine Production on the Worker ####

1. Previous requirements on workers become obsolete which opens the door to hire
   new groups of workers previously not available to capital (women,
   children). This leads to more competition on the labour market and for each
   family more members must now work in order to survive. Previously, one wage
   had to suffice for family, now 2+ wages are required to do the same.

2. Big machinery creates new motives for the extension of the working day. A
   machine decays when it is used and when it is not used → incentive to use it
   all the time. As the productivity of labour used to produce the machine
   increases, it looses value (*moral depreciation*). As productivity gains
   generalise a capitalist individual advantage in applying a certain machine
   diminishes and the rate of surplus-value drops. Capital counters this by
   extending the working day (in anticipation and in reaction). Also there is an
   incentive to use up a machine as quickly as possible (shift system)

3. Capitalist application of machines produces surplus population who are made
   redundant due to the improved productivity of labour.  They compete for the
   remaining jobs which pushes down outlay in $v$ (cf. Chapter 25).

4. Capital responds to the legal limit on the working day by mandating more
   *intense labour*, more labour in the same time. Since capital controls the
   production process in the form of its objective conditions it has the means
   accomplish this.

The machine becomes the means to get more labour out of workers.

#### The Factory ####

The *factory* replaces the fixation of one special operation (manufacture) with
universal applicability, interchangeability. Skill is extinguished, the machine
applies the worker who only needs to be able to endure that. Complete separation
of knowledge about the production process (*intellectual labour*) and the
immediate producers (*manual labour*).

This also creates a small strata of specialised workers who supervise workers
and machines.

#### The Struggle between Worker and Machine ####

The effect of capitalist application of machinery is detrimental to workers.
The machine makes workers redundant, which is not a reason to rejoice but means
greater poverty for those workers.  The machine appears as the opponent of the
worker.

#### The Revolutionary Impact of Large-Scale Industry on Manufacture, Handicrafts and Domestic Industry ####

To compete against superior productivity of large-scale industry manufacture,
handicraft and domestic industries extend and intensify the working day of their
workers.  Only when this reaches a limit, those methods of production are
abandoned.  When cheaper workers become available then these outdated methods of
production might become worthwhile again and sweatshops are set up again.

#### The Health and Education Causes of the Factory Acts ####

Even basic rules about hygiene and health have to be enforced against the agents
of production. This says everything necessary about this mode of production.

#### Large-Scale Industry and Agriculture ####

Large scale machinery revolutionises agriculture, no more farmers but rural wage
labourers.

## Part Five: The Production of Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value ##

### Chapter 16: Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value ###

In Chapter 7 the concept of *productive labour* was initially defined as
purposeful interaction with nature.  Under the capitalist mode of production
this concept changes. It becomes wider because functions which were previously
functions of the same labourer now become distributed across various
labourers. To be productive it now suffices to be an organ for the *collective
labourer*. For example, a worker exclusively coordinating the production process
is a productive labourer.

At the same time, the concept becomes narrower. Not only must the producer
produce value (first narrowing) but also surplus-value. Only that labour which
produces surplus-value is productive for capital. Which labour is productive is
determined by the purpose of capital.

The first method of production of surplus-value is the production of absolute
surplus-value: the extension of the working day. Here, capital does not
restructure the labour process: *formal subsumption*. It implements a time
relation in production which is divided into necessary and surplus labour.

This is the starting point and premise of the production of relative
surplus-value production where capital uses its command over the labour process
to restructure it according to its needs: *real subsumption*. The previously
established time relation is improved by reducing necessary labour-time and
thus increasing surplus labour-time.

### Chapter 17: Changes of Magnitude in the Price of Labour-Power and in Surplus-Value ###

Assuming that commodities are sold at value and that labour-power never sells
below its value, we have three determinants for the relative magnitudes of
surplus-value and price of labour-power.

1. the length of the working day,

2. the normal intensity of labour, and

3. the productivity of labour.

These are levers for capital to diminish the value of labour power
relatively to surplus-value. The combination of these levers allows capital to
deal with the limits of all these levers on their own.

### Chapter 18: Different Formulae for the Rate of Surplus-Value ###

The correct formula for the rate of surplus-value is

(I) $\frac{\mbox{surplus-value}}{\mbox{variable capital}} = \frac{\mbox{surplus-value}}{\mbox{value of labour-power}} = \frac{\mbox{surplus labour}}{\mbox{necessary labour}}$

which relates surplus-value to its source (in value terms and in time
terms).  Another formula is

(II) $\frac{\mbox{surplus labour}}{\mbox{working day}} = \frac{\mbox{surplus-value}}{\mbox{value of the product}} = \frac{\mbox{surplus product}}{\mbox{total product}}.$

This formula is not sound as it has no relation to how surplus-value is actually
produced. Instead, it relates it to the total product and implies a sharing of
the proceeds of joint production among capital and labour (piece of the pie).

The formula

(III) $\frac{\mbox{unpaid labour}}{\mbox{paid labour}}$

is a synonym for the first formula but invites the confusion that labour and not
labour-power is bought. But it is not mere ideology, as this expresses why
workers are hired: to produce a surplus.

> fact that it has at its disposal a definite quantity of the unpaid labour of
> other people.

## Part Six: Wages ##

### Chapter 19: [The Transformation of the Value (and Respectively the Price) of Labour-Power into Wages](chapter-19-detailed-commentary) ###

The wage form expresses the value of labour-power as a *price of labour*. This
expression is irrational as labour has no value and it is labour-power which is
bought.

However, it is not a mere false idea. Since the production of surplus-value is
the purpose of the capitalist production process, the worker's labour-power is
bought in order to put her to work long enough to realise a surplus-value $s$.
The wage is the form in which the purchase of labour power and the purpose of
this purchase are consolidated. Capital buys labour-power to put it to work for
a certain amount of time. The form of payment expresses the truth that necessary
labour is conditioned on surplus labour under the rule of capital, not the other
way around.

Time and intensity are the two determinations which characterise the magnitude
of value produced by labour. Each wage form is a reflection on these
determinants.

### Chapter 20: [Time-Wages](chapter-20-commentary) ###

The price of labour for an hour is calculated as

$\mbox{price of 1 hour} = \frac{\mbox{working day}}{\mbox{value of labour-power}}.$

But this is not merely an arithmetic operation. The production of surplus-value
necessitates that a worker produces longer than needed to reproduce her
labour-power. *Time-wages* implement this interest of capital in the worker. A
worker is only paid the full value of labour-power if she produced not only the
value equivalent of her labour-power but also surplus-value.

Now if capital employs a worker for less than a full day (*short-time work*), a
worker is not able to reproduce herself, as she is not paid the value of her
labour-power, but that is not immediately capital's problem. It is irrelevant
here if she worked more or less than necessary labour-time, as payment is
attached to the full working day which includes both necessary and surplus
labour-time.

Capital pays extra for *overtime* to compensate for the additional devastation
of such long hours.  Due to a low hourly wage workers develop an interest in
overtime. Overtime becomes the new norm, the same workers work longer, more
competition on the labour market and ability of capital to supress wages
further; increased interest of workers in overtime …

### Chapter 21: Piece-Wages ###

The price of labour per piece produced is calculated as:

$\mbox{price per piece} = \frac{\mbox{price per hour}}{\mbox{pieces per hour}}.$

Again, this is not merely an arithmetic operation. With *piece wages* the
interest of capital in high intensity of labour is implanted in the worker: work
fast and concentrated to earn more. As workers therewith increase intensity,
they provide capital with the means to lower the piece wage: the new level of
intensity becomes the norm and workers still only get paid the value of their
labour-power.

This wage form does away with many otherwise necessary forms of supervision, but
it necessitates *quality control*, where workers are only paid for products of
sufficient quality.

### Chapter 22: National Differences in Wages ###

Real wage levels may vary from country to country. What is considered a normal
level of reproduction on one country may be considered beyond this level in
another. The production of the means of subsistence might be cheaper in one
country than another (agriculture and its reliance on climate, quality of the
soil, etc.).

Yet, the production of surplus-value does not rely on absolute wage levels, but
on the rate of surplus-value. This rate might be lower in a country with a low
wage level and vice versa. Capital does not require absolutely low wages, it
presupposes the rate of surplus-value.

## Part Seven: The Process of Accumulation of Capital ##

### Chapter 23: Simple Reproduction ###

Whatever the social form of production it must be continuous. Every social
process of production is also a process of reproduction which reproduces its
premises.

Capital must reproduce constant and variable capital.  A part of the yearly
product belongs to production and exits in a use-values which are designated for
use in production (machines etc.). A part of the product of the product must
exist in a natural form in which it can function as means of subsistence of
workers (food, clothes, etc.).

If capitalists do not reinvest their surplus-value but merely consume it by
spending it on means of subsistence and luxury articles, then *simple
reproduction* takes place. Capital produces and reproduces its component
parts. It also periodically produces surplus-value which is consumed by the
capitalist and which therefore assumes the form of *revenue* arising out of
capital.

However, the mere repetition of this process brings to light aspects of this
process which do not appear when looked at in isolation.

Whatever allowed capital to initially buy labour-power, as soon as the process
is repeated, it is a worker's past labour that allows a capitalist hire her
again.

Whatever the initial investment, after a certain number of repetitions it
produced a surplus-value of the same size which the capitalist consumed. The
reason she did not consume her complete capital when she consumed the value
equivalent of it, is because her workers produced it as surplus-value. All
capital is accumulated capital, even when we leave aside reproduction on an
extended scale (accumulation proper).

The products of labour not only turn into commodities but also into capital which
then confronts the worker. At the same time, the worker is reproduced exactly
as before: she has nothing but her labour-power which she must sell to capital.

### Chapter 24: The Transformation of Surplus-Value into Capital ###

#### Capitalist Production on a Progressively Increasing Scale. The Inversion which Converts the Property Laws of Commodity Production into Laws of Capitalist Appropriation ####

So far the purpose of capitalist production was determined as the production of
surplus-value. If not all surplus-value is consumed but (part of) it is
re-invested *accumulation* takes place and capital arises out of surplus-value.
Therewith surplus-value is determined as a means of the accumulation of capital,
not its end.

For actual accumulation to take place, expanded reproduction must take
place. Additional money seeks to buy additional means of production and
labour(-power) on the market.

These commodities must be available on the market, which means they must have
been produced already by the time a capitalist extends production.  Other
capitals must have produced more machines instead of luxury articles for
accumulation to take place: expanded production presupposes expanded production
elsewhere.

If these additional means of production ought to be used productively,
additional labour is required. Capital can either increase the intensity or
extent of labour of its already employed workers. If additional workers are
required these must be available on the market — which is usually provided for
by the capitalist mode of production (cf. Chapter 25).

Given that capital can rely on finding the material means of expanded production
on the market the condition for its accumulation is its previous accumulation.

> 729:1 The ownership of past unpaid labour is thenceforth the sole condition
> for the appropriation of living unpaid labour on a constantly increasing
> scale. The more the capitalist has accumulated, the more is he able to
> accumulate.

Being the sole condition it is also the necessary condition: capitalists impose
the law to accumulate on each other such that the minimal amount of capital
required for successful accumulation increases. This way, the wealth that is
produced by workers and confronts them increases.

The complete separation of labour and wealth — that the products of labour
confront workers in the form of capital on an increasing scale — is the purpose
and consequence of commodity production of private producers, not its
adulteration.

#### The Circumstances which, Independently of the Proportional Division of Surplus-Value into Capital and Revenue, Determine the Extent of Accumulation, namely, the Degree of Exploitation of Labour-Power, the Productivity of Labour, the Growing Difference in Amount between Capital Employed and Capital Consumed, and the Magnitude of the Capital Advanced ####

If the ratio how surplus-value is split into revenue and capital is fixed, the
size of accumulated capital depends on the absolute size of surplus-value. All
means to increase surplus-value are also means to increase accumulation. Of
particular relevance here are:

* lowering wages below the value of labour-power

* economy in the application of constant capital (factory buildings etc.)

* increases in productivity, commodities get cheaper: capitalists can consume
  more even if they spend the same money, the value of labour-power falls,
  constant capital becomes cheaper, less capital is needed to expand production

### Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation ###

What effect does accumulation have on the working class?

#### A Growing Demand for Labour-Power Accompanies Accumulation if the Composition of Capital Remains the Same ####

The composition of capital is understood in two ways:

1. *technical composition* means of production and living labour and
2. *value composition* constant and variable capital.

Insofar as the value composition is a reflection of the technical composition we
speak of *organic composition*. If organic composition remains the same, then as
capital grows its demand for labour(-power) increases at the same speed. The
faster capital grows, the faster its demand for workers grows as well. This way
capital demands more labour-power than is supplied and prices rise.

This does not mean there is no exploitation:

1. Either capital simply pays those higher wages, because they are means for
   accumulation. The mass of surplus-value rises, even if the rate falls.

2. Or shrinking profits mean lessened accumulation, which lowers the price of
   labour again to a level at which it is a means for valorisation. This way the
   obstacles created by accumulation are resolved by the process itself.

In any case, not the number of workers determines employment but
accumulation. Accumulation and its needs is the independent variable and the
wage the dependent.

#### A Relative Diminution of the Variable Part of Capital Occurs in the Course of the Further Progress of Accumulation and of the Concentration Accompanying it ####

Insofar as capital uses increases in productivity as a means of accumulation, the
technical composition of capital increases. This implies a relative diminishing
of variable capital relatively to $c$ (although organic composition increases
slower than technical composition due to cheapening of $c$) and transcends the
obstacle of the previous sub-chapter.

This process of accumulation implies a growing *concentration* of the means of
production in the hands of individual capitalists. On the other hand, new
capitals are founded or capitals are split into parts (repulsion). This
fragmentation of total social capital into many capitals is counteracted by
*centralisation* where individual capitals are combined into one. Growth through
centralisation is not limited by growth of total social capital.

This way centralisation contributes to the extension of the capitalist mode of
production and of labour-saving techniques, which lessens the relative demand
for labour(-power).

On the one hand, new capital attracts relatively less new workers as it enters
the world. On the other hand, capital repels workers whenever it revolutionises
its technical basis.

#### The Progressive Production of a Relative Surplus Population or Industrial Reserve Army ####

As capital accumulates it needs more capital to employ the same number of
workers as capital that is already functioning reduces the number of workers it
employs absolutely as it restructures its production process. If this
accumulation is sufficient to employ those redundant workers depends on the rate
of accumulation and the extent to which workers are made redundant.

Successful capitalist production produces a surplus of workers which are not
currently needed: *relative surplus population*. Unemployment is not a
phenomenon of crisis, but a result of the normal accumulation of capital. The
capitalist law of population is that the working class produces the means to
make itself redundant on an increasing scale.

The surplus population is not only a product of the capitalist mode of
production but also its means: it provides reserves of labour-power so that
capital can increase its demand when needed. It functions as the *industrial
reserve army*.

Furthermore, the unemployed function as a means to put pressure on workers:

1. The threat of unemployment allows to extend the working day, which increases
   the supply of labour without (much) additional outlay in $v$. It also allows
   for economy in the application of $c$. "Overwork" of employed workers is not
   a contradiction to unemployment but the latter is used as a means for the
   former.

2. The threat of unemployment also lowers wages.

The particularity of the labour market is that accumulation is both the subject
of (increased) demand and the subject of supply by making them redundant. There
are not two independent forces confronting each other on the market, but capital
regulates the supply and demand for labour-power according to its needs.

#### Different Forms of Existence of the Relative Surplus Population. The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation ####

The industrial reserve army splits into those which are temporarily thrown out
of work and might be employed again and those which capital has no use for
permanently. As capital grows it also produces pauperism with it.

## Part Eight: So-Called Primitive Accumulation ##

### Chapter 26: The Secret of Primitive Accumulation ###

Accumulation reproduces its conditions — workers on the one side and capital (in
money form) on the other — but it also presupposes them. It needs its result as
precondition.

The initial creation of the conditions for capitalist accumulation was not the
deed of capital but of agents who pursued different interests.  A popular
ideology is that capital grew out of the abstinence (hoarding) of later
capitalists.

What needed to happen was the transformation of the means of subsistence and
nourishment into capital and the production of free wage labourers. Producers had
to be separated from their means of production.

### Chapter 27: The Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land ###

Workers were created by (forcefully) separating peasants from their
land. Previously valid feudal titles were voided.

### Chapter 28: Bloody Legislation against the Expropriated since the End of the Fifteenth Century. The Forcing Down of Wages by Act of Parliament ###

1. In its infancy capital did not manage to discipline the new
   peasants-turned-proletarians by the silent compulsion of economic
   relations. The state applied harsh punishment to anyone not working, forcing
   people into employment for capital. With the success of capital such methods
   of immediate coercion become unnecessary due to the *silent compulsion of
   economic relations*.

2. During this early phase workers were not absolutely dependent on capital yet
   and could demand higher wages. The state uses direct coercion to
   prevent them from doing so. As the capitalist mode of production develops
   setting such maximum wages becomes unnecessary.

### Chapter 29: The Genesis of the Capitalist Farmer ###

Three conditions further the transformation of rich farmers into capitalists:

1. The agricultural revolution increases productivity of agricultural
   production.

2. Appropriation of previously common land allows to augment the stock of
   cattle.

3. Contracts for farms ran for a long time (99 years). When the value of money
   dropped farmers had to pay less on rent and wages due to these expenditures
   being fixed in the old money value.

### Chapter 30: Impact of the Agricultural Revolution on Industry. The Creation of a Home Market for Industrial Capital ###

The expropriation of peasants from their land separates them from their means of
production and of nourishment which now are available as material elements of
variable and constant capital. The agricultural revolution also allows that
fewer agricultural workers feed the newly emerging proletariat in the cities.

Furthermore, a home market for products previously mainly produced for
subsistence develops. Agricultural capitalist provide the raw materials and
means of subsistence for manufacture and workers.

### Chapter 31: The Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist ###

The transformation of money hoards into capital that augments itself was helped
along by the *colonial system* which created new markets and provided cheap raw
materials by the act of plundering, *sovereign debt* which allows to turn any
sum of money into capital by lending it to the state.  This debt also helps to
create a modern *banking system* whose credit funds capitalist accumulation.
*Taxation* (in money) drives petty producers into bankruptcy, they become
proletarians.

### Chapter 32: The Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation ###

The capitalist mode of production needed the expropriation of petty producers to
develop. As it develops this expropriation continues and big capitalists eat
small capitalists. What is not true — in contrast to what Marx claims — is that
there is an inherent historical necessity for this development due to the
development of the productivity of labour.

Having explained how capital appropriates the labour process to make it its
means over the last 31 chapters, Marx now does a 180 and presents us with a
*historical materialist teleology* where the *productive forces* are the subject
which does away with modes of production when they become an "obstacle". The
capitalist mode of production as a means for the development of the productive
forces:

> 929:1 The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production
> which has flourished alongside and under it. The centralization of the means
> of production and the socialization of labour reach a point at which they
> become incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst
> asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators
> are expropriated.

Unfortunately, we are still waiting …

### Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonization ###

Means of production and workers are not sufficient for the capitalist mode of
production. It needs social relations which compel workers to sell their
labour-power to capital.
