1.1 The Two Factors of the Commodity: Use-Value and Value (Substance of Value, Magnitude of Value)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 125:1 The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production
> prevails appears as an ‘immense collection of commodities’;

In the first sentence Marx defines the object of analysis. He studies wealth as
it appears in capitalist societies. One might object that the wealth of
societies actually presents itself as the GDP or as debt or as money or …
However, here the starting point is much more simple: people need and want to
eat, shelter, tools to fix and produce stuff etc. – that is the material wealth
they need in any society. In this society, however, this material wealth appears
in commodity form and this particularity is the starting point of the
analysis. Hence, when Marx writes "appears" it expresses that the content
“wealth” appears in a specific mode: as the commodity.

To avoid anticipating the remainder of this chapter, we must for now rely on a
superficial dictionary style definition of what we mean when we say
“commodity”. In economics, in particular around the time when Marx was writing,
a commodity is something which is produced for sale or exchange.[^1]

This first definition of a commodity points to the attribute of the wealth under
consideration here that it needs to be produced. It consists of products of
labour. The things people consume are produced first and somehow production is
related to consumption: what is produced for whom, who produces it and how.  By
definition this is a feature of any division of labour.  What can change,
though, is how this “coordination” is accomplished, the social form.[^107] Or as
Marx put it in response to his critics:

“Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let
us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too, that the
amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand
differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society’s aggregate
labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social
labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form
of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws
cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically
differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves.”[^2]

How these laws assert themselves and what additional laws assert themselves if
the wealth of societies appears in commodity form is the subject of
investigation.

Marx’s starting point is rather different from modern economics. The starting
point of modern economics is management of scarce resources in general:
“Economics … studies the behavior of individuals, households, and organizations
…, when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to
achieve desired ends.”[^3]

1. Marx’s starting point is an immense collection of *wealth* not scarcity.  The
   fundamental claim of current modern — i.e. neoclassical – economics is
   scarcity. We pick this up again below.

2. Marx’s starting point is the particularity of the capitalist mode
   production. The commodity form is a *particular* form in which wealth appears
   and is to be investigated as such: what is the commodity? Modern economics,
   on the other hand, claims to not to be specific to this society.  It claims
   to study the use of scarce resources in general and posits that the market is
   the most efficient mechanism for dealing with scarcity. They do not
   investigate the particular social form that they deal with but posit from the
   beginning that it is best; they do not study what actually exists but start
   from a positive verdict which they want to justify.  Therewith, these authors
   miss the observation with which Marx starts.

> 125:1 the individual commodity appears as its elementary form. Our
> investigation therefore begins with the analysis of the commodity.

The appearance of material wealth in commodity form is the starting point of the
analysis, not its end.[^17] With the observation that wealth takes a particular
form, we are not done, we are just getting started. Marx's project is to start
from a simple observation and to proceed to the explanation. Marx attempts a
systematic development — from elementary to developed — of political economy in
capitalism, not just a list of observations.

We should take this project seriously and ask ourselves in every step how (if at
all) it followed from the last and should avoid the temptation to use results
that we anticipate later in the book to account for a claim made in the
beginning. The arguments developed later presuppose the elementary categories
and arguments developed in the beginning and cannot be used to explain those
elementary arguments in retrospect.

### Use-Value

> 125:1 The commodity is, at first,[^4] an external object, a thing which
> through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind.

Following his predecessors[^5] Marx here clarifies that he means *material
wealth* when he speaks of wealth. He speaks of *objects* that are useful to us.

There are other things that might come to mind when we think of wealth in
general which do not seem to be covered by this definition: "services". Does a
haircut belong here? How about a train ride from London to Glasgow? How about a
conversation? These examples are not discussed here.  For now, we should think
of material objects when Marx talks of the wealth which takes commodity form.
Perhaps it is helpful to realise that all these "services" rely on material
objects themselves to be performed (scissors, trains, …).

It is useful to think about these "services" in order gain some clarity what the
object under consideration is. It is also useful to distinguish why these
"services" do not fall under consideration here. The "service" haircut produces
a material result, but maybe not an external object. The "service" legal
counselling does not produce such an immediate material result.  Marx's
restriction to material objects should be noted and how these different
"services" fit into what is being discussed here is a discussion that can and
should be had at a later point of the investigation.  However, one cannot reject
this restriction on the grounds that one can think of other aspects, such as
"services", not being covered.

With "first of all" is expressed that what follows is not the final word on the
commodity. At this stage of the argument we may think of the commodity simply as
material wealth, i.e. we may ignore its specific social form as a commodity: it
is produced for exchange.  This form will be considered in a few paragraphs, but
whatever the social form is, it does not mean it is not material wealth.

> 125:2 The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the
> stomach, or the imagination, makes no difference.

Marx states that it does not matter why someone wants something.  Important is –
for now – only that she wants that thing. He does not make this claim to express
a personal preference, taking a position on whether there should be "essential"
desires and "artificial" ones. This distinction which many people think about
when they think about needs and desires is not what Marx comments on
here. Instead, he is concerned with understanding the capitalist mode of
production. He observes that on the market it does not make a difference why
someone wants a particular commodity. The statement is a scientific statement,
not a judgement how something should be.

This indifference towards why someone wants something requires that a certain
level of abundance must have been achieved. If the production of food is the
foremost question since people just about manage to produce enough in order not
to starve being subject to somebody's whim would not be the way in which
production, distribution and consumption of food would be organised for
long. For example, assume that in a given society producers just about manage to
produce enough wheat to feed producers for the next year so they can produce
wheat and other useful objects for the year after. In this society using wheat
to build a flour pool in analogy to Scrooge McDuck's money pool would undermine
the reproduction of the whole society, it would cease to exist.  The societies
under consideration here are not dominated by nature imposed scarcity but there
is freedom to decide what wealth to produce for what purpose.

> 125:2 Nor does it matter here how the thing satisfies man's need, whether
> directly as a means of subsistence, i.e. an object of consumption, or
> indirectly as a means of production.

Useful objects can be used in individual consumption where they are consumed and
that's it. They can also be used in productive consumption where they are used
as means to produce other useful objects. For example, wood is chopped and
either used to heat a home or used to make a chair. So this "coordination" of
production and consumption does not only relate production to consumption in the
sense that stuff that is consumed must be produced. It also relates production
to its own means: for production the means of production must be produced first.

> 125:3 Every useful thing, for example, iron, paper, etc., may be looked at
> from the two points of view of quality and quantity.

A particular thing satisfies a particular need, not any need. If I’m hungry I
want ice cream not chairs. From this perspective things are very much not
interchangeable, they are of different qualities. When Marx writes "quality" he
does not mean "good" and "bad quality", but quality as in particular properties.

Also, I do not want ice cream as such but some quantity of ice cream. These
statements will be explained more below.

> 125:3 Every useful thing is a whole composed of many properties; it can
> therefore be useful in various ways. The discovery of these ways and hence of
> the manifold uses of things is the work of history.

“Usefulness” is an expression of a relation between someone’s desire or need and
the physical properties of some external object. Discovering applications for
things is a historical process. For example this means discovering that magnets
can be used to point north. But this also means to discover that wood can be
turned into paper which then satisfies an entirely different need than wood. By
"work of history" is expressed that this knowledge must be acquired once and can
then be passed on to others, who do not have to rediscover it independently for
themselves.

> 125:3 So also is the invention of socially recognized standards of measurement
> for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of the measure for
> commodities arises in part from the diverse nature of the objects to be
> measured, and in part from convention.

We count things in particular ways according to their qualities.  For example,
we usually do not count chairs in weight but simply number them when we are
concerned with their usefulness for sitting on them. We count flour in weight,
we might count water sometimes in weight and sometimes in volume, depending on
how we look at it. Sometimes the choice of quantifying in volume instead of
weight comes down to convention. Always down to convention is how we express
length, weight etc. If we use the metric system or imperial is a question of
convention.

Overall, we do not say 12 water but 12 litres or 12 kilograms of water, but we
do say 12 chairs, because chairs are of such a quality that this makes
sense. Even how we quantify different things (chairs, wheat) differs between
them (weight, lengths, counting, volume).

> 126:1 The usefulness of a thing makes it a use-value. But this usefulness does

> which is the use-value or useful thing.

A thing is useful because of its physical properties: the relation between me
and the thing requires specific properties in the thing. Things must be organic
to be edible for example.  It might be a human activity that discovers that
certain mushrooms are edible but it is their physical properties which allows to
discover this. Mushrooms have the capacity to be edible because of their
particular physical, chemical, etc. properties. All possible uses have the
physical properties in common: "One and the same use-value can be used in
various ways. But the extent of its possible application is limited by its
existence as an object with distinct properties."[^19] Usefulness is grounded in
particular qualities of a thing and these qualities make it a useful thing.[^6]
Marx here defines "useful thing" and "use-value" as synonyms.

> 126:1 This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour
> required to appropriate its useful qualities.

Earlier we determined material wealth as useful objects which are produced,
i.e. products of labour. However, considered purely as a useful object the
amount of labour required to produce them is irrelevant. A piece of wood I found
on the street is as useful as a piece of wood for which I had to chop a
tree. When we find faster ways of producing coats, we can produce more coats in
the same time. Yet, a coat still keeps you warm the same. Use-value is a
category of consumption, not of production.

> 126:1 When examining use-values, we always assume we are dealing with definite
> quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron.

To realise the qualities of use-values a certain quantity is necessary and
sufficient: With one grain of wheat I cannot eat my fill. For a two person
household usually one fridge is sufficient, four are usually too many for this
purpose. To make use of a certain quality it needs to be available in a certain
quantity. One brick is not enough to build a house, 1 billion is too much. One
grain of rice is too little for a meal, 100g perhaps about adequate. Put
differently, to build a house one does not want bricks, many bricks or more
bricks. One wants however many bricks it takes to build a house: definitely a
definite quantity.

Even if we do not know much many bricks it takes to build a house or how much
pasta it takes to fill us up, the actual task itself determines this
quantity. Our ignorance does not change this.

This observation stands in constrast to the central category of modern
econimics: scarcity. Scarcity — "there is not enough" — is a relation of how
much stuff there is vs. how much someone wants for some purpose; scarcity is a
category of a relation between stuff and need.  It does not make sense to say
there is not enough coffee, but we have to say "not enough for what?". In the
same way, we need a certain amount of bricks to build a house, not just bricks
or many bricks.  Bricks are no scarce or plentiful in general, but in relation
to whatever we want to do with them.

Yet, in modern economics stuff is defined as scarce regardless of the need that
confronts it. Consequently, when these economists start with scarcity they do
not consider the actual shortcomings around them or even rack their brains how
to overcome them, e.g. “there aren't enough iPods so we can all listen to Sting
at the same time, how do we make more?”  Instead, they simply require and posit
scarcity as such as the first category of their economics. Because of this
notion of scarcity, they also completely disregard production to make their
case. Of course, there are things of which there is only a limited supply. But
of many things more can be produced and this fact is disregarded in modern
economics when scarcity as such is assumed. For example, a popular example is
beach-front homes, i.e. something which is thought of as limited by its
location, it is thought that you cannot make more.  Another common example
is that in a dessert a glass of water would be a lot more valuable than in
modern London. In a desert somebody would give everything for a glass of water
because it is so scarce, you cannot make more. However, the object of
investigation is the capitalist mode of production with its "immense collection
of commodities" on the market and not a single exchange relation in a dessert
where there is no market and no production for the market.  Under capitalism no
need is not fulfilled just because something is scarce per se. If I own enough
to exchange I can fly to space or own as many beach front homes and glasses of
water as I want. Modern economics investigates and advertises a particular way
of organising production and consumption – i.e. the capitalist mode of
production – and starts off with disregarding production to introduce its first
premise: scarcity.

> 126:1 The use-values of commodities provide the material for a special branch
> of knowledge, namely the commercial knowledge of commodities.

Studying all the various use-values is of practical importance, even
economically. However, this is a separate body of knowledge from understanding
the commodity.

> 126:1 Use-values are only realized in use or in consumption.

Use-values realise their potential to satisfy human needs when they are
consumed. The realisation of use-values also extinguishes them. This is palpable
when we consider things like food or petrol, which are immediately extinguished
when we consume them. Other objects are not immediately extinguished when we
consume them, but they wear out more slowly, they die a slow death so to
speak. Hence, there is a continuous need to produce and reproduce commodities
under all social organisations of production and consumption.[^23]

### Exchange Value ###

> 126:1 They constitute the material content of wealth, whatever its social form
> may be.  In the form of society to be considered here they are also the
> material bearers of … exchange-value.

Recall that in the first sentence the object was defined as the particular form
of wealth as it appears in capitalist societies. We then moved on to studying
the content of this wealth, the commodity's body considered as a useful
object. But it is their commodity form which is specific to the capitalist mode
of production. Consequently, the use-value side or usefulness is not how to
proceed. While use-values will play a role later during the investigation, we
cannot derive the particularity of the commodity from use-value. Material wealth
consists of useful objects without appearing in commodity form.

In all societies people need to eat and in all possible social organisations
people need to work to produce the stuff to consume. This cannot change, as
pointed out above. What can change, however, is the social form in which
consumption is related to production. One such form is the market which makes
exchange-value a particular social quality of wealth in societies where the
capitalist mode of production prevails.

> 126:2 Exchange-value appears first of all as the quantitative relation, the
> proportion, in which use-values of one kind exchange for use-values of another
> kind.

For now, exchange-value appears as a relation between two use-values. If one can
get two chairs for one ton of apples, then two chairs are the exchange-value of
one ton of apples. By "one kind" is expressed that the next ton of apples also
gets two chairs — if the apples are of the same kind. Exchange-value is not a
property of a particular batch of apples, but every ton of apples has this
property.

With "relation" is expressed that not only one ton gives access to 2 chairs but
that e.g. two tons grant access to four chairs. Exchangeability is not bound to
one ton. This might seem trivial and self-evident but it is not: one could say,
for example, we want everybody to be able to get chairs, so as you buy more and
more chairs they become more and more expensive (measured in apples) or,
alternatively, one cannot even buy more than two chairs, full stop. But this is
clearly not how this society exchanges. From this we might conclude that in this
society it is a quality of apples to be exchangeable for chairs.

If one takes this standpoint and considers exchange-value as a property of the
commodity (an assumption which will be corrected in the following) then apples
are determined "exchangeable for chairs" which we might also express as "means to
access chairs" or "chair access resources". While the use-value of apples is
their quality to satisfy hunger and appetite, exchange-value — as far as we have
determined it so far – as a property of apples means one can get access to
chairs with them.

> 126:2 This relation changes constantly with time and place. Hence
> exchange-value that is inseparably connected with the commodity, inherent in
> it, seems a contradiction in terms. Let us consider the matter more closely. 

A year ago one ton of apples might have allowed to get three chairs. In
Birmingham this might still be the case, while in London one only gets two. In
one street apples might exchange for different quantities of chairs. Perhaps
even the same apple owner negotiates different "chair prices" for her apples
with different people. In light of these variations one could, when asking how
come that apples have the power to access chairs, conclude that this was indeed
not a potential of the apples. One could say as Butler in footnote 7: "The value
of a thing Is just as much as it will bring." This way, the explanation of
commodities as means of exchange would cease before it really started: all
random. Or one says that it is not random but essentially determined by the
appreciation of the persons involved in the trade. Then exchange-value would
depend on the various needs and desires of people and it would be wrong to say
that every apple has the same exchange-value. One would have to say: every apple
has all kinds of different exchange-values, depending on who has the apple. One
also could not talk about relations: if one ton of apples fetches two chairs,
this would not mean that two tons result in four chairs. To claim that the
exchange-value was grounded in the apple being an apple independent of the
subjective appreciation by the exchangers, that would be the position of an
"objective theory of value". The other standpoint would be that of the
"subjective theory of value", which makes up the modern mainstream in
economics. It considers the objective theory of value to be absurd by the
arguments listed above. However, these arguments deserve scrutiny:

### Value ###

A commodity does not only exchange for one particular other commodity, but for
many. That means it does not only have one exchange-value but many, in various
relations. The apple is not only a “chair access resource” or is not only “means
of access to chairs” but also a "boot-polish access resource", a "silk access
resource" etc. "Many exchange values" here means: apples are access resources to
any other use-value in this society which is available on the market.

This “content distinguishable from it” that all these exchange-values express is
a somewhat quantified "exchangeability as such" as a property of the
apple. Apple owners can access all material wealth that is available as a
commodity in this society.  How far this access reaches is only a question of
how many apples they have. Apples have the characteristic that they are access
resources to social wealth in a capitalist economy, where social wealth means
material wealth that is available in society, i.e. on the market.  That one can
use apples to access chairs is then only an expression of the more general
quality of apples to access anything. Apples do not have chairs as
exchange-value because apples are access resources to chairs, but because they
are *means of access sans phrase*. All those different exchange-values express
this same quality of the apple *about the apple*.

On the other hand, the "valid exchange-values of a particular commodity express
something equal" namely that for apples they all count as representatives of
social wealth.  Considered as exchange-values all commodities only count as
particular instances of social wealth as such, they are all the same. This is a
statement about all exchange-values of the apple, *about boot-polish, silk, gold
etc.*

An analogy: say Elizabeth is in a position of authority towards Alice.  We could
say that this is due to the special relation between Elizabeth and Alice or by
chance. However, let's say Elizabeth is also in a position of authority towards
Bob, Charley, Eve. In fact, let's assume Elizabeth is in a position of authority
towards everybody else. Each of these particular relations of command and
servitude are merely particular modes of expression of Elizabeth's power to
rule. At the same time Alice, Bob, Charley, Eve, etc. are all mutually
replaceable, they are all Elizabeth's subjects and count as particular
expressions of this.

Relative to those arguments above against the objective theory of value, we
hence have to say: while the definite proportions and quantities might change,
what remains is the quality of apples to access chairs. Furthermore, the
relations between apples and other commodities might change as well, but what
remains is the quality of apples to be exchangeable for them.  Quantitatively a
lot might change, but the quality of the apple to be exchangeable for, to grant
access to, any part of social wealth — given enough apples — remains. What gives
apples this power?

If a ton of apples gives access to two chairs, then it is also true that two
chairs allow one to get one ton of apples, this is just the perspective
reversed.  All the arguments in the last paragraph also apply to chairs. Chairs
are not only exchangeable for apples, because they are apple access resources
but because they generally have the quality of quantified exchangeability.
Chairs, too, represent means of access to the wealth in this society.

This is where the analogy from the last paragraph stops working. In that analogy
Elizabeth was not Alice's ruler because she was Alice's equal, on the contrary.
In contrast to this, commodities are not in a one-directional relationship of
access but relate to each other as *equal*. Chairs access apples because apples
access chairs, and vice versa.

In exchange the chair recognises our apples as a bit of social wealth, too.
This answers the question of what gives our apples the power to be exchangeable
for any other bit of social wealth: they are a bit of social wealth themselves.
Apples are means of access to a bit social wealth because they *are*. Commodity
exchange means that any particular bit of social wealth counts as a greater or
lesser quantity of social wealth as such.

The third thing which is neither apples nor chairs, but contained in both of
them is that they are quantities of social wealth sans phrase. What is this
social wealth in general?

Determined as social wealth as such the particular qualities of commodities as
apples, chairs, iron, corn do not matter, given the right quantity they are all
the same. Exchange-value is not only a disregard of a particular quality of
commodities, exchange-value expresses the disregard of any quality of the
use-value: "precisely by its abstraction". The only difference they are capable
of as social wealth as such is that of magnitude. The key point is not that they
might differ in quantity, but that they *cannot* differ in quality.

We are looking for a common basis which characterises a commodity as social
wealth as such which in turn grounds its capacity to access social wealth in the
hands of others. From this it should be clear that our search for the "third
thing" is not one of the kind: what kind of things can I think of that they
might have in common. If that was the case, we could arrive at the conclusion
that all things have a mass or have something to do with particles or
so. Conclusions we could then try to disprove by finding counter examples. Yet,
this does not explain their quality "to give access to social wealth because
they are", these commonalities, if they exist, do not explain what goes on when
a society exchanges its products of labour and therewith equates them.

Every commodity needs a use-value. Only when there is need in society for a
thing, it may be used to attract the interest if other members of
society. However, the usefulness of a thing cannot be quantified. If I want to
sit down on a table with five people then I need a table and five chairs. Four
chairs do not satisfy this need, six chairs do not offer more usefulness for
this purpose than five. The standpoint "at least I have three chairs, then only
two people need to sit on the floor" is an expression of managing scarcity and
not an expression that five chairs satisfy a need better than three. Five
satisfy my need, three don't. More generally, if we compare the usefulness of
different use-values then the statement that a bicycle would be more useful than
lunch is pretty absurd. If I am hungry a bicycle does not help, if I want to get
from A to B lunch is of no help.

However, for many people these alternatives, comparisons and quantifications
appear as rather straight-forward. They think about their day-to-day life and
there such questions appear quite often … due to limited spending power: "Do I
treat myself to a good meal and don't go to the pub or vice versa?" However,
when asking this question we already compares the amount of our money with the
price of the two things we would enjoy doing. We come to the conclusion that
these magnitudes do not match up and hence we have to limit ourselves. Only
after we compared the respective magnitudes we arrive at limiting our needs and
desires. Only after this step we make the absurd but forced upon ourselves
comparison: what can I do without. This way the daily struggle appears as if the
exchange relations were determined by use-values or our own individual needs and
desires.

Two comparisons between use-values are sensible, but have nothing to do with the
question considered here: Firstly, I can compare a use-value in relation to a
particular need. If I want to drink a hot drink, a cup might be more useful than
a glass. A bicycle, however, certainly does not come to mind. Secondly, I can
ask myself whether remodelling my room is worth the effort if it takes up so
much time and energy that afterwards I do not have time to enjoy my remodelled
room. The effort puts the benefit so much into question that I rather not have
the benefit. This relates effort to benefit for a particular useful thing, but
certainly does not relate different useful things.

From the perspective of the commodity seller, usefulness is definitely not what
founds exchangeability. She does not want to use the commodity but exchange
it. For her it does not have any usefulness at all. The owners of the BMW
company may want drive, say, 10 cars themselves, the remain thousands of cars
which are produced every day are certainly not useful to them. For those who
want to have one of those BMWs it too cannot be irrelevant how many apples they
have to give up in exchange for it. One could say, well those apples do not have
use-value for them, so it does not matter how many they have to give up, they
gets what they really want. Because access to use-values in this society is
dependent on how much I own, use-value only plays the part that it must exist in
exchange; the exchangers confront each other on the exchange-value side. Because
everybody does it, an individual decision also does not play a big role. I have
to take other exchange relations into account and take part. By taking part I
contribute myself that others too cannot act accordingly to their individual
preferences.

Finally, that the particular use-values are not the point when we are
considering the exchange-value side of commodities is illustrated by the fact
that any use-value — if there is demand for it in society — enables one to
exchange it for all other things in society if I own them. Producing gold,
fertilisers or toilets, all these things do not differ qualitatively as to what
wealth I can get access to. If I have enough, I can exchange them for what I
need and desire, because they are recognised as social wealth themselves.

### Labour

> 128:2 If then we disregard the use-value of commodities, only one property

We are searching for an answer to the question what it means to speak of social
wealth as such in disregard of its particular qualities as particular useful
objects. What does it mean to speak of an apple as a bit of social wealth as
such, in abstraction from its apple-ness as a foundation for the apple's
capacity to access any social wealth?

It is clear that material wealth must be produced, it does not fall from the sky
but requires effort.  It is also clear — cf. Marx' letter to Kugelmann above —
that under any mode of production somehow society's labour must be directed,
production and consumption "coordinated". However, in the societies "where the
capitalist mode of production prevails" not much coordination is actually going
on.  Producers produce in private, without a common plan. Instead, they produce
for exchange and only on the market they find out if their products can be
exchanged for those products which they need. On the market they find out if the
product of their efforts is recognised as social wealth, if their labour was in
vain or not. The form in which production and consumption are coordinated is
that the products of labour all count as a bit of social wealth as such if they
are successfully exchanged. In a commodity producing and exchanging society the
fact that it requires effort to produce material wealth is used to make the
other exchanging party hand over its bit of social wealth in return. This is
what we mean when we say that commodities recognise each other as social wealth.

There are many things which are not products of labour which still can be
exchanged. What about those? Virgin soil for example. Marx deals with virgin
soil and how its value is determined in Volume 3. For now, we can say: for the
things we need to live, things which require no labour at all, are the
exception.[^8] Marx will pick this up again briefly at the end of this
sub-chapter.

Now we arrived at the conclusion that social wealth as such is somehow related
to labour. How?

### Abstract Labour

By producing a chair, a use-value, carpentering is concrete. By producing a
chair which has exchange-value carpentering produces social wealth as such. The
chair as social wealth as such is not the chair as the use-value, that's what
makes it special, different from houses and wool. The social-wealth-as-such
producing side of house-building does not consist in connecting bricks by
cement. The social-wealth-as-such forming side of carpentering, house-building,
cheese making is that labour as such was performed.

When producers produce commodities they not only produce particular useful
things but also each a bit of social wealth as such. All their labour together
in the world of commodities counts as one and the same mass of labour of which
each of them produced a part as a particular commodity.

Of course, human labour-power is always expended with a certain form, as such
without form it does not exist. Nobody performs abstract human labour as such,
one always performs "concrete labour". Furthermore, one could always take the
position to abstract away the concrete sides of spinning, weaving, baking … when
considering them and call the result labour as such: purposeful interaction with
nature … that is how its talked about later. But that's not what is meant when
we say abstract labour.

The labour that produces social wealth as such is abstract labour. In this
society an abstraction which I could make in my head is what becomes the
standard which characterise my product as wealth. By treating the products of
labour as qualitatively equal the labours that produced them are also treated
equal. This abstraction is not something we do as a part of our scientific
investigation, but something that the participants on the markets do when they
exchange. While this abstraction can in principle always be made it is not a
product of labour in itself that this abstraction to pure expenditure becomes
the relevant social property of wealth as such; instead, this requires
particular social relations in which labour is performed. Put differently, it's
not a quality of labour to produce value but a quality of the market to reduce
labour to homogeneous human labour.[^10] The physiological equality of all
labour, that there actually is a commonality in labour, is the material basis,
the condition, for the social relation of abstract labour, but it is not that
social relation itself. The fact that all labours are the expenditure of human
labour makes it possible for society to treat all labours as equal, but is by
itself not yet this equal treatment.[^20]

After having discussed social wealth as such for a few paragraphs Marx finally
gives it a name: value.

When Marx talks about human labour "expended without regard to the form of its
expenditure" then the following is addressed. When the purpose of production is
the production of value (which is the purpose of the commodity producer who has
no interest in using the commodity himself) then the branch of industry is
irrelevant. Whether I am a carpenter, a weaver or a builder is all the same,
when the purpose of production is to produce value. When I notice that some
branch of industry does not allow me to get hold of as much value as another, I
switch branches. Hence, for example, farmers who stick to farming regardless of
how much it gains them in terms of value and insist on passing their land to
their children, don't quite fit in the capitalist mode of
production. Value-forming labour is indifferent against the preferences for a
particular labour (whatever the reason for this preference).

This attains a different harshness when one cannot switch branches. This could
be because one does know have the necessary skills or the necessary means of
production. The indifference towards the branch of industry as a determination
of value-forming labour asserts itself against the producer where she is
restricted to one branch. Where people insist on the particular branch or have
to stick to it, the producers perish of this demand.  Abstract human labour is a
determination which asserts itself as purpose and demand against concrete
labour.

It is not correct to say that a commodity is a use-value and an exchange-value
or even to say it has one exchange-value. Instead, a commodity is a use-value
and is a value of which its various exchange-values (one chair exchanges for $x$
beer, $y$ wines, $z$ cheeses, …) are only expressions.[^12]


### Socially Necessary Labour Time: Magnitude of Value

If the substance of value is abstract human labour, its magnitude is amount of
abstract human labour. How do we measure such a magnitude?  Marx here measures
labour in time to arrive at an expression which quantifies it. Certainly, we can
say that working longer means more labour is expended, insofar is time a measure
of labour. However, two labour processes could take the same amount of time but
be of different intensity. One of them would expend more labour-power in the
same time as the other. In this case time would not actually be an adequate
measure of amount of labour. This is taken up again later in chapter 15:
intensity and time are the two measures of abstract labour.  For now,
normalising intensity – i.e., treating more intense labour as equivalent to
longer less intense labour – we are left with the measure of time.

A chair producer who needs longer to produce a chair than the next guy does not
produce more value with one chair. On the contrary: the value of one chair is
the same as the value of another chair, regardless of who produced it and how
long she took to do it. This points to the fact that chair maker competes
against chair-maker. As values the chairs are treated equal and therefore the
labour that produced them is treated equal and equated. In retrospect this means
that only that chair-making time counts as value-producing which lives up to
this comparison.

When a product of labour contains value and is exchanged on the market, this is
not a reward of some sort for labour performed. The actual labour expended on a
particular product is not what counts, but only how much time is socially
necessary. The commodity in one's hand functions as lever to gain access to
social wealth because it takes effort to produce it, not because you worked hard
to produce it. That's your problem.

If a producer Alice needs a ten hour working day to produce a chair, but on
average two chairs are produced in the same time, then Alice's chairs still have
the same value as all the other chairs. That the average counts as
value-producing, on the other hand, also applies to the fastest producer.  If
Bob manages to produce four chairs per day, he produces twice as much value than
the average.

This means from a value perspective it makes sense to try harder, to improve
one's skills, to work more intensely and with a higher level of productivity.
Only, if everybody does that then the relative advantage is gone.  If all
improve their performance per time then this new level is the normal, necessary
and average. They all wanted to achieve more value per time with their
performance but the end result is that they produce just as much value as before
the big push for more performance.  This will be taken up again later in the
part 4.

This also means that somebody who for whatever reasons has physical or
intellectual disadvantages is likely to fail on the market. Education,
socialisation etc. all have the same effect.  That labour which is less
efficient because of it, compares less favourably on the market.  Put
differently: this justice of the market means that those whose physical or
intellectual skills are less developed than for others are in a worse position.

The same is true for the means of production.  The best physical strength does
not mean much if someone else can work twice as fast because of a technological
advantage. The question is then whether one can keep up through sheer
expenditure of body strength.  However, this increased expenditure definitely
means the devastation of one's health, that's for sure.  Value-producing labour
is ruthless against the concrete side of labour.

There is a standard of value-producing labour which one has to live up to. How
does this standard come about? Through an average of what e.g. chair producers
producing for the market need to produce a chair. All of them together form this
standard. Every individual, concrete chair making labour enters. On the other
hand, every concrete, individual labour time has to related to this standard and
is measured against it. This standard confronts each producers as an external
fact against which she is powerless. By doing so she contributes to this
standard herself.

We need to differentiate between how much one contributes to the standard,
though. If only one company owns a technology which allows them to produce much
faster than their competitors and hence produces 90% of all commodities sold on
the market then this individual contribution has the respective weight when
contributing to the average. If this company competes with 1000 independent
artisans who produce 10% of the commodities sold on the market, then their
individual performance only enters with about that weight.

On the one hand, socially necessary labour means that only that labour-time
counts as value-producing which is necessary on average to produce a commodity
not how much time was needed to produce it. On the other hand, this expresses
that too many commodities can be produced relative to effective demand. This
side of socially necessary is discussed in chapter 3.

That the determination of average labour performance asserts itself across
branches can be explained as follows. Let the average output of yogurt producer
per day be 10 litres of yogurt. Now, a chair producer, say, realises she could
produce 20 litres of yogurt per working day. She hence switches branches. This
pushes up the average in the production of yogurt. Let’s assume further her
market share is small and the average hence remains relatively low, i.e., the
increase is hardly noticeable and 10 litres of yogurt have the same value as 2
chairs. Our skilled branch switcher hence produced twice as much value as before
when producing chairs. Other producers from other industries will notice this:
if they switch to yogurt they can produce much more value in a day than if they
stick with chairs or whatever they are making. More and more will switch to
yogurt and role up the market: the average increases. The eventual result will
be that 20 litres of yogurt will be the average output of one day of yogurt
production. Now, if the chair production did not change, 20 litres of yogurt
are now worth as much as 2 chairs.

The indifference towards the particular branch of industry, which is in the
concept of abstract human labour, hence is presupposed here. Labour is thrown
where it is worthwhile. This way, the determination of socially necessary
labour-time asserts itself across branches.

The productivity of labour is a determination of concrete, useful labour. It
expresses efficiency by stating how many goods can be produced per time. The
more skillful a labourer the more goods she can produce per hour. Using the right
tools – means of production – one can increase the productivity of labour
enormously. Using a wedge can increase how much one can lift, using a basket
allows one to transport a lot more stuff than not using one. Nature, too, can
play a decisive role. The same amount of labour may produce a lot less potatoes
given bad weather conditions than given good conditions. If one is drilling for
oil it makes a huge difference whether one hits it after 50m or 1500m, the
latter requires a lot more work.[^13]

Because productivity is a quality of concrete, useful labour it does not enter
the magnitude of value side. While an edge in productivity is beneficial for a
producer because her commodities are measured by the average, this advantage is
gone as soon as the competition catches up.  More commodities are produced per
day but not more value than before. The value of a single commodity decreases,
because the measure of value is socially necessary labour-time.

From the standpoint of use-value and from the standpoint satisfaction of needs
and desires one can say: the faster a use-value can be produced the more goods
can be produced per day, the more people in need of that good can be provided
for. Or: if everybody is provided for we can work less if we are able to work
faster. Advances in productivity would enable more spare time.

From the standpoint of value this advance in productivity is of no benefit as
soon as it becomes the normal way of producing things. The mass of value that is
produced in a day simply remains the same. If value is concerned an increase in
productivity is no reason to work less. Spare time which one can enjoy is not
part of the programme of value. Value does not service the labourer, but the
labourer has to service value, has to act in accordance to its demands.[^14]

So abstract labour as the substance of value and socially necessary labour-time
as the measure of value isn't just another way of saying that people produce
stuff. These are statements how they produce. More precisely how they confront
each other in this society and what that means for the labour they perform.
Abstract labour is performed where commodities are produced. On the other hand,
abstract labour does not mean nothing, i.e., one could be tempted to think that
if abstract labour is something specific to this society it would have nothing
to do with labour as performed under all kinds of different social conditions. A
reading, which is perhaps aimed against a reading of abstract labour by
Leninists who think of it as a condition of human existence, holds that abstract
labour has no physiological side to it, that would be a naturalistic
reading. Hence, one doesn't know much more about value by reducing it to
abstract labour: one fairly empty social category is reduced to another. A
meaningless reduction, one could drop the mention of “labour” from “abstract
labour” and one is not any further in one’s analysis than before the
reduction. Yet, it is one thing to explain that the physiological equality,
i.e., that people do stuff, does not constitute value, it is another thing to
claim value would have nothing to do with it. What is lost in this abstract
account are the results about what abstract labour as a social rule does to
concrete labour. That is, this way the critique of abstract labour is lost,
i.e., the account what it does to concrete labour and the immediate producers if
pure expenditure of labour-power, pure toil, something purely negative is what
counts. Abstract labour asserts itself against the immediate producers because
it turns a physiological quality of their activity against them, reduces their
activity to it.

Marx’ comment that diamonds probably never have been paid for at their full
value, is quite confusing. After spending so much time on deriving value and
abstract labour as the substance of it, he comes out and says that commodities
do not necessarily fetch their value on the market. Put differently, the price
of a commodity (which will be discussed on sub-chapter) is not necessarily
quantitatively the same as its value. How this works is only fully explained in
volume 3. However, for most of what follows Marx makes the simplifying
assumption that things are bought and sold at their value.

> 131:0 (Now we know the substance of value. It is labour. We know the measure
> of its magnitude. It is labour-time. The form, which stamps value as

> characteristics we have already found somewhat more fully.)

We have established that on the market the products of labour confront each
other as social wealth as such, they are reduced to the effort it takes to
produce them. This effort, which is stripped of its content, is measured in
time. But note that labour is not value.

David Harvey writes: “This allows him to formulate the crucial definition of
'value' as 'socially necessary labour-time;' which 'is the labour-time required
to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given
society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent
in that society:' He concludes, 'What exclusively determines the magnitude of
the value of any article is therefore the amount of labour socially necessary,
or the labour-time socially necessary for its production’ (129). There is your
definition.”[^16]

This is not what Marx says nor is it correct. Socially necessary labour-time is
the measure of the magnitude of value, it is neither its substance nor is it
value. Value is the quality of commodities to command social wealth because they
are. What gives them this quality is that it takes effort to produce
them. Socially necessary labour-time measures this effort.  This is pointed out
here because this identification of Harvey (and others) lends itself to missing
the point of this first sub-chapter: the crucial bit is not that value is
somehow related to labour but the social relations that arise when labour is
performed in private and related through exchange. Only then the products of
labour become leverage against other producers and the labour needed to produce
them becomes that what exclusively counts.[^22]

The condition for a product of labour to be a commodity and to be value is to be
useful to others, but not only useful to others in some way, but useful to
others who can and do recognise it as a bit social wealth as such in
exchange. Only products of private producers who produce for exchange confront
each other as value-determined commodities. Things which are not produced for
exchange do not have value and neither do things which are not products of labour
but are exchanged on the market.

### Private Labour and Social Division of Labour

The social division of labour is a determination of concrete, useful
labour. Some produce food, which feeds others who produce means of production
which are used by the food producers to produce food etc.  Insofar the producers
do not only produce for themselves every society has a division of labour. In
factories too we find a division of labour.  One person has to check the
temperature of the milk while another person has to feed milk bottles to the
bottling machine while another person has to take the completed bottles out of
the machine. All these activities for themselves are useless, only their
combination produces useful things and hence prepares the being of these things
as commodities. In a factory the partial labours are coordinated and the final
purpose of labour is known in the head of the foreman a priori and in accordance
with this purpose labour is divided up into tasks and related. Yet, in a factory
workers do not exchange intermediate products, they are not commodities.

> 132:4 Only the products of mutually independent self-directed private labors
> face each other as commodities.[^2]

In capitalist societies, too, labours depend on each other. Intermediate
products, like windscreen wipers and tyres are offered as commodities and
Volkswagen and Crysler get their hands on these intermediate products through
exchange so they can put together complete cars. Here, too, it seems we find a
form of division of labour. Windscreen makers would be out of business if it was
not for others who produce cars. Only together in combination can windscreen
wiper makers and car makers produce a final car. At the same time, these labour
processes are private labours. What somebody produces is subject to her whims,
subjectivity and freedom, no one else has a say in this. Afterwards a kind of
division of labour appears, but the path towards it is based on the separation
of the labour process. Afterwards we can see that labour was divided up, but
this division of labour was not directed in accordance with the
result. Everybody gets busy himself and what the outcome of this activity is
presents itself afterwards. In contrast to the division of labour in factories
the division of labour in capitalist societies does not follow a plan.

> 132:3 Coats cannot be exchanged for coats.

because the basis for exchange is the neediness of the other. If she already has
a coat why should she be interested in coat in the hands of others. The
separation from the things they need is the basis of commodity production.

The sense of division of labour in commodity production is then that the
division of labour in the form of private labours is not a relation of
complementation, but a relation of dependencies which one has to satisfy and
which one wants to exploit. Everybody produces in a speculative way: what is
needed by those in society who have the means to exchange?  Whether it is
needed, nobody knows a priori. Even if during the last few years a particular
product was needed, it is not clear whether now the competition wipes one off
the market or whether the intermediate product one produces became redundant
because of technical advances elsewhere.

If one produces something that others indeed need who own a value equivalent,
then the task is to exploit this dependency and to get as much as
possible. This, all producers do reciprocally, such that a standard develops to
which every single one contributes but no single one controls. This standard is:
value-producing labour is such, which retrospectively was proven to be part of
social labour through the process of competition.

### Development of the Social Division of Labour

> 132:5 In a society in which products generally take the form of commodities,
> i.e., in a society of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between
> the useful labors that are carried on independently from each other as the
> private businesses of self-directed producers, develops into a system with
> many components, a social division of labor.[^3]

In capitalist societies there doesn't simply exist a social division of labour,
it develops constantly with a tendency to smaller and smaller intermediate
products. Factories are put up that only produce containers for certain acids
used in the chemical industry and another factory only produces screws for these
containers. This is not simply the course of human history but specific to this
mode or production. The basis for specialisation in capitalism is the interest
of commodity producers in advances in productivity of labour, because that is
advantageous value-wise. While this advantage lasts only temporarily, it is a
permanent motivator.

The development of the social division of labour or specialisation of labours is
based on exploiting this interest in a competitive advantage.  The tyre company
Conti makes BMW the offer: you can produce your own tyres or your can rely on me
as a specialist which means your tyres are produced faster (and cheaper) which
gives you an advantage in competition with Volkswagen. The same offer is made to
Volkswagen such that no company in the car industry might have an advantage, but
no participant can afford not to accept the offer.

The development of the social division of labour in capitalism is founded in
producing and exploiting dependencies for value.

That sometimes more tailoring is required, sometimes less, sometimes more house
building, sometimes less, is not only a fact but from what we learned so far a
necessary consequence. The indifference towards concrete labour does not mean
that one does not need to care, but the standard every producers has to live up
to and which constantly changes what socially necessary labour means.

Value producing labour is ruthless against a certain branch of industry or
activity, what implies that producers have to be flexible to fulfil this
requirement. This is the issue at hand with simple and complicated
labour. Simple labour is that labour which the average worker can perform. This
might be tasks which are essentially simple manual labour such as cleaning,
carrying stuff, pressing buttons, standing on many assembly lines. Where those
things are concerned every human with average knowledge and strength can work.

In the 80s handling computers was not common knowledge, an average worker could
not work where computers needed to be operated. However, today every child can
use a computer because they are introduced to them at young age at home and at
school. Even warehousers need to know a little about computers these days. What
is considered average labour hence changes over time. Technical development and
common knowledge taught in school are the main levers for this.

In the 80s handling a computer was the work of a specialist. Those who had this
skill were not as easily replaced by other workers. This made their labour
complicated labour. Complicated labour is that which cannot easily be
replaced. This is something different from what was discussed when discussing
socially necessary labour time. There, the labour of one strong gal could be
replaced by the labour of two not so strong guys.  The strong person is
replaceable by two not so strong people. When we talk about complicated labour
we talk about labour which is not as easily replaceable. For example, because
people need a special education (software development etc.) and/or a lot of
experience (surgery etc.).

While in socially necessary labour a worker produces more value per time because
she works faster than the average, complicated labour produces more value per
time because it is removed from comparison to some extend.

The permanent development of the productivity of labour obliterates these
advantages continuously. What was considered specialised knowledge yesterday is
now done by a machine which only needs somebody pressing a button. It is a
permanent process of de-qualification. On the other hand this requires new
specialised knowledge because those machines need to be maintained and repaired.

Furthermore, the state contributes to the back and forth of simple and
complicated labour by organising public general and specialised education.

Finally, a word of caution. Complicated vs. simple labour has nothing to do with
how valuable a producer is. That is, complicated labour does not produce more
value because the worker is worth more, for example, because his education did
cost more. It produces more value because she is not as easily replaced and one
can hence command more value with the products. Education is a contributing
factor why it is more difficult to compete against such a worker, but its price
does not explain the value difference. Marx mentions a time when bricklaying was
complicated labour because capital exhausted the labour force to such an extend
that finding people strong enough to perform this work was not that easy.

1.3 The Value Form, or Exchange-value
-------------------------------------

In themselves commodities are only useful objects, things, stuff.  However, what
characterises these objects as commodities is that they have a dual nature they
are

> 138:1 at the same time objects of utility and bearers of value

This double character must find expression, otherwise these commodities are only
objects. However, the value character of commodities has its substance in
abstract human labour having been expended on producing them. Their value
character is hence a purely social character and it can only appear in social
relations, the social relation between commodity and commodity. Expressed as a
contradiction: the commodity is value but its value-quality is its quality to
access social wealth: a purely social quality; value is a social quality of a
thing. The leading question of this subchapter is now how to express this
quality adequately.

In itself no commodity is able to express its value, it must express this
quality in another commodity. Its quality of being social power of access must
appear in relation to that wealth it represents power to access to. The simplest
such expression is to relate two commodities and the first question is whether
this expresses value adequately.

Everyone knows, if nothing else, that commodities have a common value-form which
contrasts in the most striking manner with the motley natural forms of their
use-values. I refer to the money-form. (139)

A second sub-question Marx promises us an answer to is the genesis of
money. Everybody knows that money is immediately value, it is valid power of
access to social wealth. Why that is the case ought to be answered by answering
the first question: how is value expressed adequately.

Finally, a small methodological pointer. Roughly speaking, the development of
the first question “how does a commodity express its value” is emphasised when
the relative form of value is discussed. The second question “how does money
come to be immediately value” is emphasised when the equivalent form is
discussed. That is, it might be tempting to reduce the development of the
equivalent form of value to the mere mirror of the development of the relative
form of value and hence to miss the development of money as master over
commodities in this sub-chapter.

### The Simple, Isolated, or Accidental Form of Value

> 139:3 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or: 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat

In this form of value two commodities are related to each other, each of which
plays a very different role. The first commodity – the linen – is in the
relative form of value and expresses its value. The coat is in the *equivalent
form* of value and expresses the value of the linen. The first commodity – linen
– plays the active role, the second commodity – coat – plays the passive
role. The linen expresses its power to access social wealth by comparing itself
with coats.

Note that “20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat” is not saying that 20 yards of
linen are *exchanged* for 1 coat. Rather it means that the linen tells a third
commodity: my power of access is that of the coat. This is highlighted here
because Ehrbar's notes discuss the simple form of value through the act of
exchange of linen and coat. This is misleading. The point here is to express
value not to exchange. Here the question is that of expression of the power of
access which logically comes before exercising this power: exchange. A
hypothetical situation, to visualise what is going on, could be that the linen
wants to exchange for coffee and expresses its social power of access to the
coffee by equating itself with coat.

Both forms are inseparable moments of the same expression. One cannot have one
without the other. For one commodity to be in the relative form of value it
needs another commodity in the equivalent form to express its value. 20 yards of
linen are worth 20 yards of linen is not an expression of value, it is a
tautology. It does in fact only express that linen is linen, a definite quantity
of some object. It says nothing about the linen being an access resource to
things which are not linen.  This is not an expression of value.

Of course, we may choose to reverse the expression: “20 yards of linen are worth
1 coat” becomes “1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen”. This is, however, a new
expression, we now express the value of the coat, not the linen. Linen and coat
change their roles and the question we ask and the answer we get is different
from the question we ask here: what is the value of linen, how much wealth as
such does it command?

However, before considering this quantitative question we turn our attention to
the qualitative dimension. Whatever the concrete numbers, the linen makes a
claim about itself in the simple form of value.

*Qualitatively* the simple form of value expresses the linen as coat equal by
association of the linen with the coat. That linen is linen the linen expresses
in itself. In equating itself with the coat, the linen also claims I am not only
linen, I am also coat equal. Sure, linen does not claim that you can wear it
like a coat, yet it is coat equal.

> 142:1 This is a roundabout way of saying that weaving too, in so far as it
> weaves value, has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring, and, consequently,
> is abstract human labour.

In relation to the labour that produced linen the linen makes a similar claim. I
am not the result of weaving I am also result of the same labour that produced
coats.

> 142:2 The value of the linen as a congealed mass of human labour can be
> expressed only as an ‘objectivity’, a thing which is materially different from
> the linen itself and yet common to the linen and all other commodities.

In this society labour creates value, the quality to command social wealth. This
quality the linen attempts to express: I am a means of access, social command
that can be owned. This quality must hence be expressed in something that itself
can be owned – a thing: “I as a thing have the quality of that other thing.”

*Quantitatively* the *absolute* value of linen is expressed as a *relation* of
a quantity of linen with quantities of coats. This means:

1.  If the amount of labour required to produce linen changes, but that of the
    coat remains the same, then the quantitative expression of the value of the
    linen changes proportionally to that change. All good then.

2.  If the amount of labour required to produce linen does not change, but that
    of coat changes, then the quantitative expression of the value of the linen
    changes inverse proportionally to that change.  Although the magnitude of
    value of linen did not change, its expression does change. 

3.  If the amount of labour required to produce linen and coats changes in the
    same proportions then the expression of the value of the linen does
    change. The value of the linen changed but its expression did not.

> 146:3 Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally
> nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression, or, in other words,
> in the magnitude of the relative value. The relative value of a commodity may
> vary, although its value remains constant.

This is analogous to the International Prototype Metre, i.e., the object which
used to define what a metre is. As a natural object the International Prototype
Metre is subject to decay, it hence slowly shrinks. Stating that Alice is about
2 x the International Prototype Metre hence expresses different absolute lengths
depending on the year and hence the level of decay.

#### The Equivalent Form

> 142:3 Here it [the coat] is therefore a thing in which value is manifested, or
> which represents value in its tangible natural form. Yet the coat itself, the
> physical aspect of the coat-commodity, is purely a use-value. A coat as such
> no more expresses value than does the first piece of linen we come across.

The coat, in the equivalent form, is passive, only material for the linen to
express its value. Furthermore, the coat has the same dilemma as the linen: for
itself it is only a use-value and its value character is not expressed. However,
through the action of the linen something happens: its natural form, its
use-value becomes the immediate expression of value. Coat is access to material
wealth as such because the linen expresses its quality of being access to
material wealth by equating itself with the coat. In its relation to the linen
the coat acquires a new determination which it does not have outside of this
relation: coat means value.

For comparison assume Alice wants to express her quality as a Marxist and
states: I am a Marxist as Bob. Indirectly, this means that at least Alice takes
Bob to be a Marxist. That might be correct or not, but by expressing her Marxist
qualities through a comparison with Bob Alice claims that Bob immediately has
the quality of being a Marxist.

The linen by expressing its own value-quality by equating itself with coat, coat
counts immediately as value for the linen. This also implies that coat can
always be exchanged for linen:

> 147:1 The commodity linen brings to view its own existence as a value through
> the fact that the coat can be equated with the linen although it has not
> assumed a form of value distinct from its own physical form. The coat is
> directly exchangeable with the linen; in this way the linen in fact expresses
> its own existence as a value. The equivalent form of a commodity, accordingly,
> is the form in which it is directly exchangeable with other commodities.

The linen says: I am value because I am like coat, hence as value I am as good
as coat, coat is my standard of value which I claim to live up to. This identity
as value implies that coat is immediately exchangeable for linen – this is what
value means: exchangeability. Thus, while the linen only says I am coat equal,
it also implies coats are immediately exchangeable for me.

However, as the equivalent form the coat looses the ability to express its own
magnitude, its magnitude of value is not expressed as magnitude of value any
more. The coat figures as a definite quantity of a thing in the
value-relation. The magnitude of value of linen is hence equated with a
magnitude of coats. The contribution of the value form is that a magnitude of
coats counts as a magnitude of value.

The advance in the value-form analysis is that in its attempt to express its
value the commodity in the relative form of value assigns a special role in the
hierarchy of commodities to the commodity in the equivalent form. The problem
for the linen and any other commodity was that it could not express its value
character independently. However, this character must become visible in order to
use the linen as power of access, i.e., the power of access must be made visible
in order to actually access. Through the expression of the value of the linen in
the coat, the coat now does not have this problem any more:

> 148:1 The first peculiarity which strikes us when we reflect on the equivalent
> form is this, that use-value becomes the form of appearance of its opposite,
> value.

Independent of the value expression of the linen the coat as the same problem as
the linen. One cannot see its value character. But as equivalent form the coat
does not have this problem, its use-value, its natural form, its coat-ness, is
sufficient: coat is value. While linen has to enter a relation with the coat in
order to express its value-character, the commodity in the equivalent form is
immediately value and does not need to do this.

> 150:1 The body of the commodity, which serves as the equivalent, always

If coat counts immediately as value within the value expression, then tailoring
as concrete useful labour immediately counts as value-creating labour. Tailoring
hence does not produce things which keep you warm in winter, but immediately
produces social power of access. Tailoring immediately is labour as such,
weaving only because it is equal to tailoring.

The last barrier a commodity must pass over is that privately produced things
have to proof to be part of the social division of labour that is produced by
accident and opposition between the producers. The commodity in equivalent form
has also already taken this barrier. Every tailor produces things which
immediately fit into the social division of labour:

But because this concrete labour, tailoring, counts exclusively as the
expression of undifferentiated human labour, it possesses the characteristic of
being identical with other kinds of labour, such as the labour embodied in the
linen. Consequently, although, like all other commodity-producing labour, it is
the labour of private individuals, it is nevertheless labour in its directly
social form. It is precisely for this reason that it presents itself to us in
the shape of a product which is directly exchangeable with other
commodities. (150)

#### The simple form of value considered as a whole

The commodity is use-value and value. It is a component of material wealth, a
particular branch of it, and it is command or power over this material
wealth. On the one hand, it is the material of this command, the servant, on the
other hand it is that which is command, the master.  The value dimension cannot
be expressed in a single commodity, it must be expressed in relation to other
commodities. The result of this attempt at expressing this quality is a
hierarchy in the commodities. In the expression of value the equivalent form
counts immediately as value.  The commodity in equivalent form counts
immediately as socially valid power of access. On the other hand, the commodity
that tries to express its value immediately counts only as use-value. The
degrading of use-value to a bearer of value reappears as the degrading of the
commodity in the relative form of value with respect to the commodity in the
equivalent form of value. Its attempt to express its quality of being command
over social wealth, retaliates. The commodity creates an opposite which
immediately counts as value and hence degrades itself. It wants to say “I am
value” but in comparison to the equivalent form which it creates it is doubtful
whether it is value.

For comparison lets consider the example from above. When Alice claims to be as
much of a Marxist as Bob she says that Bob is a immediately recognised as a
proper Marxist. At the same time Alice expresses the need to highlight her
Marxist qualities by comparison with Bob. While Bob immediately is a Marxist,
Alice has to prove it. This creates doubt: is Alice really a Marxist or is this
just a claim?

From the attempt to *express* the value character of a commodity develops the
need to *prove* it. This question will be pursued further in Chapter
3. For now we continue with the question on how to express the value character
of commodities adequately. Here, the simple form of value has its
problems. Value is the social quality of a thing to access the material wealth
of society. In the simple form of value this property is however expressed only
in a single commodity and not in the world of commodities. The linen only claims
to as good as coat as a value.  Thereby it imprints on the coat the quality of
being value. However, this implied claim is limited. Only the linen relates to
coat that way.  Coat is only immediately exchangeable for linen, as only linen
claims it to be value. Hence, the linen failed to express its value properly and
a relation to the whole of the world of commodities is required.

To continue the Marxist analogy. If Alice claims to be as much of a Marxist as
Bob, Charley might ask “Who is Bob? I don't recognise Bob as Marxist.” This way,
Alice failed to express her quality of being a Marxist.

### The Total or Expanded Form of Value

> 154:4 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb. tea or = 40 lb. coffee or = 1
> quarter of corn or = 2 ounces of gold or = 1/2 ton of iron or = etc.

#### The expanded relative form of value

In a row the 20 yards of linen now express their value in all kinds of different
commodities. This way the the linen announces that it is not only coat-like, but
commodity-like. It expresses that the labour congealed in it is equal to all
other labours which produce commodities.  Hence, the value-character, which is
indifferent towards the particular use-values, is expressed more adequately than
in the simple form of value.

#### The particular equivalent form

> 156:1 Each commodity, such as coat, tea, iron, etc., figures in the expression
> of value of the linen as an equivalent, hence as a physical object possessing
> value. The specific natural form of each of these commodities is now a

> specific, concrete, and useful kinds of labour contained in the physical
> commodities now count as the same number of particular forms of realization or
> manifestation of human labour in general.

With respect to expressing value adequately this form still has a series of
defects.

#### Defects of the total or expanded form of value

> 156:2 Firstly, the relative expression of value of the commodity is incomplete,
> because the series of its representations never comes to an end. (…)

> 156:2 Secondly, it is a motley mosaic of disparate and unconnected expressions
> of value.

The total form of value does not express the value character of linen as the
unity of all commodities but simply in a series of simple expressions of
value which are not connected. This way the linen does not express its
value-character but only that it is equal to coats, to tea, to coffee …
Insofar the defect of the simple form of value is not actually fixed.

> 156:3 And lastly, if, as must be the case, the relative value of each
> commodity is expressed in this expanded form, it follows that the relative
> form of value of each commodity is an endless series of expressions of value
> which are all different from the relative form of value of every other
> commodity.

The second defect is all the more apparent when each commodity takes on its
own total form of value, they are all different from each other, are not
commensuable.

These defects correspond to defects in the equivalent form

> 156:2 Since the natural form of each particular kind of commodity is one
> particular equivalent form amongst innumerable other equivalent forms, the
> only equivalent forms which exist are limited ones, and each of them excludes
> all the others.

In the simple form of value the coat received the verdict from the linen to
be immediately value. This way the linen produced the doubt whether it is
value. Now the linen assigns the quality of being immediately value to all
kinds of commodities in a row and hence doubts the immediate value character
of the commodities in the particular equivalent forms. If it is not enough
to express its value character in coat, well then coat is not the definite
expression of value.[^4]

> 156:2 Similarly, the specific, concrete, useful kind of labour contained in

The labours that produced the respective commodities in the equivalent form
do not stand for labour as such by the same argument as above.

To pick up the earlier comparison again. If Alice says she is as much of a
Marxist as Bob but also as Eve, then she expresses that it is not self-evident
that Bob himself is sufficient to express the quality of being a Marxist – if
that was the case then there was no need to mention Eve.

The result of the simple form of value was that a commodity stamps the quality
on the commodity in equivalent form to be immediately value, and thereby
degrades itself to a value of questionable certainty. However, the defect of
this form of value – it does not express access to social wealth as such, only
insofar the coat has it – necessitated the total form of value. However, through
the total form of value the commodity then again denies the commodities in the
particular equivalent form the quality of being immediately value. Value hence
has no independent expression and is not adequately expressed. We need a
value-form in which the relation to all of the commodities is not accomplished
through a juxtaposition of commodities but through a unified form of appearance.

### The General Form of Value

#### The changed character of the form of value

In the previous value forms the linen was active and expressed its value using
the rest of the world of commodities. The general form of value, on the other
hand, develops as the common deed of all commodities. All commodities are active
and express their value in the commodity in the general equivalent form … except
for the commodity in that form.

The defects of earlier forms are therewith obliterated:

> 158:3 The new form we have just obtained expresses the values of the world of

The relation to the whole world of commodities is unified: since all commodities
relate to linen as the equivalent every commodity relates to all other
commodities through linen.

> 158:4 A commodity only acquires a general expression of its value if, at the

Every new commodity entering the market does not produce a problem for the
expression of value, it does not question the value character of all other
commodities as in the previous form (“how much are you worth expressed through
me?”). Instead, each new commodity is required to submit to the general form of
value if it wants to be part of the game.

> 159:1 In this form, when they are all counted as comparable with the linen,

All commodities represent themselves as linen-equal. Linen counts as immediately
valid abstract wealth and social power of access. By relating to a specific
amount of linen, they all express their own magnitude of value. All commodities
do this and hence relate their own magnitudes of value by relating their
respective linen amounts to each other.

The equivalent form, here linen, is not sabotaged. Because all commodities
express their value in it, linen is immediately exchangeable with all
commodities and hence immediately socially valid power of access.

All commodities can now express their value except one. The commodity in the
general equivalent form cannot express its own value quality, but it is value
and does not need to. To express its magnitude of value we have to revert to the
previous form with all its problems.

#### The transition from the general form of value to the money form

The money form does not differ qualitatively from the general form of value. The
only difference is which commodity really takes on the equivalent form and hence
can claim the unique power of being immediately value. Historically, this was
gold.

### The Money Form

Because gold achieved the status of being the universal equivalent form and
hence of being immediately valid value it is now sufficient to use the simple
form of value to express value in a socially valid way:

> 163:1 The simple expression of the relative value of a single commodity, such
> as linen, in a commodity which is already functioning as the money commodity,
> such as gold, is the price form. The ‘price form’ of the linen is therefore:
> 20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold.

The price is the value expression of a commodity in the money commodity.  By
representing itself as money-equal a commodity expresses its value
adequately. However, what is not expressed in the price form is that this is
only possible (contrary to the simple form of value) because all other
commodities do the same.

To finish the earlier analogy. Alice can now say “I am a Marxist like Karl
Marx.”[^5] Karl Marx is universally recognised as immediately Marxist and by
declaring to be Karl-Marx-equal Alice expresses her quality to derive the price
form etc.

The price form founds the basis for a prominent false conception of
money. People take gold to be identical with social wealth because it is gold,
because it is shiny, has a certain weight. Gold in this view is money because it
is gold. The value form analysis shows that this quality of gold is due to the
rest of the commodities relating to gold as the immediate expression of
value. Only within this social relation gold is by nature value.

The value-form analysis resulted in: gold is money because all other commodities
express their value in the natural form of gold. Only within this relation gold
appears as immediately socially valid abstract wealth. Gold mining is
immediately value-producing and gold miners produce immediately social
wealth. Although they have no active part in being the material for all other
commodities, they get rid of any doubt whether they are value or not. Gold
becomes the first among equals, the rest is degraded to second. The other
commodities have to express their value-character and they must do this in the
money-commodity.

The commodity is value. This is the independence of the commodity. But it can
only express its value insofar it relates to a commodity which counts as
immediately value – money. Then, however, the independence of value in the
commodity is questioned if there exists a commodity which immediately counts as
value. This is the dependence of the commodity.  The money commodity is
immediately value, it counts as such. This is the independence of money. On the
other hand, it only counts as such insofar the other commodities express their
value in it. This is the dependence of money, it is dependent on the world of
commodities.

1.4. The Fetish-Like Character of the Commodity and its Secret
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this subchapter Marx reflects on how the determinations found so far are
reflected in the consciousness of those who are practically concerned with
commodities, i.e., at this level of presentation of commodity producers. First,
neither the use-value side of commodities is unknown nor the ingredients of what
becomes value in this society, That is,

1.  that the objects of consumption need to be produced,

2.  that it is important to consider the time it takes to produce the
    things for consumption,

3.  that one doesn't produce everything one wants to consume oneself but that
    there is a division of labour,

all these things are well-understood and no mystery. However, how these
determinations play their role for commodities is something not many people
know. In particular, that these determinations do not appear as such, but
wrongly. The weirdness of a social quality of a thing is what they deal with on
a daily basis but do not understand:

> 164:2 The equality of the kinds of human labour takes on a physical form in
> the equal objectivity of the products of labour as values; the measure of the
> expenditure of human labour-power by its duration takes on the form of the
> magnitude of the value of the products of labour; and finally the
> relationships between the producers, within which the social characteristics
> of their labours are manifested, take on the form of a social relation between
> the products of labour.

Hence,

1.  that the respective concrete labours are reduced to homogeneous abstract
    human labour appears in the form of equality of the products of labour: “my
    commodity exchanges for theirs”;

2.  that the socially necessary labour time determines the magnitude of value
    appears as the relation of magnitudes of value of their commodities: “my
    thing is worth twice as much as theirs”;

3.  the social relation of the commodity producers appears as a social relation
    of products of labour: “My coats do not sell on the market any more, well,
    then I'll produce linen instead.”

Only in exchange their nexus, total social labour, appears and how well they are
doing in this sort of division of labour is expressed through their commodities:
“How much does this commodity command?” The people in this society produce this
strange social context but it appears to each of them as if she was reacting so
objective constraints:

> 167:1 Their own movement within society has for them the form of a movement
> made by things things, and these things, far from being under their control,
> in fact control them.

> 164:3 I call this the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of
> labour as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is therefore
> inseparable from the production of commodities.

Marx uses the analogy of the fetish, an object which is attributed supernatural
powers and which ought to inform the actions of people while in reality when
people bow down to the fetish they bow down to their own fantasy. The analogy is
insofar fitting as in the world of commodities people also bow down before their
own products as if they had their own lives. However, the analogy breaks down
when we consider that we can recognise religion as what it is and stop
worshipping. Then the power of the fetish over us is broken. We can also
understand the capitalist mode of production but this does not mean the power of
commodities over us is broken. Capitalism is no illusion it requires a social
act to get rid of it. First, there is the state which guarantees private
property and hence lays the foundation for commodity production and
circulation. Then there are people who accept this offer and on that basis
produce the social relations of a society based on commodity production.

Commodity producers do not benefit from the insight presented so far. In their
practical activity they have to live up to the standards of abstract labour
which they do not control but are presented to them on the market in the form of
commodity prices.

What initially concerns producers in practice when they make an exchange is how
much of some other product they get for their own; in what proportions can the
products be exchanged? As soon as these proportions have attained a certain
customary stability, they appear to result from the nature of the products, so
that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear to be equal in
value, in the same way as a pound of gold and a pound of iron are equal in
weight, despite their different physical and chemical properties. The value
character of the products of labour becomes firmly established only when they
act as magnitudes of value. These magnitudes vary continually, independently of
the will, foreknowledge and actions of the exchangers. (167)

The only relevant question for practically dealing with commodity production is
how much one gets for one's commodity. The fact that on does not control the
price of the commodity is known to commodity producers, they have an estimate
how much they can ask and see how good their estimate was on the market. Their
dependency on the rest of commodity producers is also clear to them, they are
presented with the prices of the competition on the market and the price they
can command from their customers. The realisation that this is down to abstract
labour does not enlighten these realisations. In particular, it is of no use in
deciding what to produce and how.

### Interpretations

Many different interpretations of the fetish-like character have been offered.

Commodity fetishism is often mistaken as "consumerism": people want stuff they
ostensibly do not actually need. This is clearly something very different from
what Marx discusses in this subchapter. In fact, while this reading attributes
great agency to the actors by asking them to readjust their spending, the fetish
subchapter emphasises the opposite: commodity producers have to live up to the
standard of abstract labour which appears to them as an objective constraint.

David Harvey talks about commodity fetishism as a lack of knowledge about the
production chain.[^6] One does not know who produced the commodity under which
conditions. Harvey hence is exclusively concerned with the use-value side of the
commodity and the problem he identifies exists in any reasonably complex
society.  The issue talked about in this chapter, i.e., how our social relations
of production appear to us as relations of the products of labour, is hence lost
completely.

Commodity fetishism is also often talked about as “necessarily wrong
consciousness”.

In Capitalism one is required to relate to commodities and money as means for
satisfaction of needs. But these two are the reason why needs and desires remain
unfulfilled and which introduce irrational demands which one has to satisfy. One
hence has to relate to things as means which are not. A bit like a tool which is
so bad it does not actually perform the task it is supposed to. The practical
consciousness in Capitalism is that one has to relate to commodities and money
as one's means but they are strictly speaking not. In this sense "necessarily
wrong consciousness" is correct: one necessarily has to relate to these things
in a wrong way in practice.

A notion close to this is that we relate to commodities and money as means which
are beyond our control and understanding because they have their own life. Even
the most successful capitalist does not control the market and if there is a
crisis she is confronted with this economic development beyond her control.
Some take from this the critique that humans do not adequately understand the
society they live in. This reading takes interest in the commodity fetishism
because it expresses this lack of understanding and enlightenment. This reading
takes away "things are not as they appear" or "social relations appear
reified". The kernel of this critique is that it is a problem if something is
not properly understood. This is a rather abstract problem, many situations are
plausible in which the issue that one does not understand something does not
present itself as a problem.  In particular, this way the economic
determinations what appears how and what this means for the satisfaction of
needs is lost, which is unfortunate.

In both previous versions necessarily wrong consciousness stood for how people
relate to commodities and money in practice. Nothing prevents people from
theoretically working through the laws of this society and to arrive at the
conclusion that they are detrimental.  However, often "necessarily wrong
consciousness" is taken as that people have no choice and cannot see through the
social conditions.  Of course, the existence of the speaker making such a claim
disproves the theory: she saw through the fog of ideology why should it be
impossible for others? The practically enforced consciousness of the world of
commodities does not necessitate a theoretical consciousness. However, some
theoretical consciousness bears the mark of translating practical consciousness
into theory.

    to satisfy wants or needs.” and cites Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the
    Critique of Political Economy", International Publishers, New York, 1987,

[^6]: In the first edition Marx contends himself with: “It is the utility of a
    thing for human life that turns it into a use-value. By way of abbreviation
    let us term the useful thing itself (or commodity-body, as iron, wheat,
    diamond, etc.) use-value, good, article.” (Karl Marx, "Capital", 1st

    simple terms how land is valued in a capitalist economy.

[^10]: "Labour seems a quite simple category. The conception of labour in this
    general form – as labour as such – is also immeasurably old. Nevertheless,
    when it is economically conceived in this simplicity, ‘labour’ is as modern
    a category as are the relations which create this simple abstraction.[…]
    [T]his abstraction of labour as such is not merely the mental product of a
    concrete totality of labours. Indifference towards specific labours
    corresponds to a form of society in which individuals can with ease transfer
    from one labour to another, and where the specific kind is a matter of
    chance for them, hence of indifference. Not only the category, labour, but
    labour in reality has here become the means of creating wealth in general,
    and has ceased to be organically linked with particular individuals in any
    specific form. Such a state of affairs is at its most developed in the most
    modern form of existence of bourgeois society – in the United States. Here,
    then, for the first time, the point of departure of modern economics, namely
    the abstraction of the category ‘labour’, ‘labour as such’, labour pure and
    simple, becomes true in practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which
    modern economics places at the head of its discussions, and which expresses
    an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society, nevertheless
    achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most
    modern society. […] This example of labour shows strikingly how even the
    most abstract categories, despite their validity – precisely because of
    their abstractness – for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific
    character of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of historic
    relations, and possess their full validity only for and within these
    relations." (Karl Marx, "Grundrisse", p. 103ff)

[^11]: “accumulated” here shouldn’t be confused with accumulation later in this
    book. The German text has aufhäufen here, which can be translated as amass,
    accumulate, pile.

[^12]: David Harvey's description of value – of which exchange-value is a form
    of appearance – is wrong as he describes value as the unity of use-value and
    exchange-value: "Having begun with use-value and exchange-value-a
    dichotomy-he then arrives at a unitary concept of value …" (David Harvey, "A
    Companion to Marx’s Capital", Verso, London, 2010, p. 32)

[^13]: The oil price is not fully determined by this. The switch of branches of
    industry discussed above which enforces the law of value for commodities is
    not necessarily possible: there are only a few regions in the world which
    have oil and hence simply throwing more labour at the problem is not
    necessarily possible for someone who does not access to these regions.

[^14]: "A commodity as a use-value has an eminently material function. Wheat for
    example is used as food. A machine replaces a certain amount of labour. This
    function, by virtue of which a commodity is a use-value, an article of
    consumption, may be called its service, the service it renders as a
    use-value. But the commodity as an exchange-value is always considered
    solely from the standpoint of the result. What matters is not the service it
    renders, but the service rendered to it in the course of its production."

[^17]: That the appearance which confronts us is not the last word on wealth in
    a capitalist society is expressed by it being mentioned in the first rather
    than the last sentence of Capital. However, many commentators only pick up
    on the distinction between essence and appearance or turn it into one of
    truth and false semblance: "But notice something about the language.
    'Appears' occurs twice in the passage, and, plainly, 'appears' is not the
    same as 'is.' The choice of this word - and watch out for it, because Marx
    makes frequent use of it throughout Capital - signals that something else is
    going on beneath the surface appearance. We are immediately invited to think
    about what this might be." (David Harvey, "A Companion to Marx’s Capital",
    Verso, London, 2010, p. 15) "However, how something appears does not
    necessarily match how it is, it's just how that what is appears." (an
    earlier version of our own commentary) These comments miss the point of this
    paragraph: the distinction between the content material wealth and its
    commodity form.

[^23]: That some objects wear out even when we do not use them, is no counter
    argument to this claim. The claim is not that only consumption wears out
    objects, but that whatever else might cause it, consumption does so,
    too. That some objects wear out so slowly that we can pretty much ignore it
    from a practical standpoint also does not constitute a counter argument to
    the claim that continuous production and reproduction is necessary for a
    society to survive.

[^103]: Ehrbar's translation, Fowkes' translation is too far off.

[^104]: Marx phrasing is that each particular equivalent form excludes all others,
    i.e., the agency rests with the equivalent forms.  In our summary, we put
    emphasis on the agency of the relative form of value, i.e., it doubts the
    immediate value-character of coats by relating to tea as well. The end
    result of the value-form analysis will be that the commodity in equivalent
    form is active and subjects the commodities in the relative form of value …
    by the actions of the commodities in the relative form of value. However, in
    order to avoid anticipating we chose a more passive account than alluded to
    by Marx here.

[^105]: Who said he wasn't a Marxist, but that's not the point here.

[^106]: “Not only do you not have to know anything about that labor or the
    laborers who congealed value in the lettuce in order to buy it; in highly
    complicated systems of exchange it is impossible to know anything about the
    labor or the laborers, which is why fetishism is inevitable in the world
    market. The end result is that our social relation to the laboring
    activities of others is disguised in the relationships between things. You
    cannot, for example, figure out in the supermarket whether the lettuce has
    been produced by happy laborers, miserable laborers, slave laborers, wage
    laborers or some self-employed peasant. The lettuces are mute, as it were,
    as to how they were produced and who produced them.” David Harvey – A
    Companion to Marx's Capital, p.40

[^107]: It should be noted, though, that just because the commodity form
    mediates production and consumption, this does not imply that the
    reproduction of society or its members is what it is about.  The starting
    point of the investigation is that the capitalist mode of production
    reproduces society, this does not mean, however, that it must necessarily do
    this.
