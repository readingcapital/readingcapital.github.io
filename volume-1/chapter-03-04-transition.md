title: The transition from the third to the fourth chapter

*Alice:* One is dependent on commodities, which can be converted into money and
then to use this money to bridge the gap between oneself and another
commodity. Here, money is first of all a means (the facilitator between
commodity and commodity) and not purpose of the whole operation.

*Bob:* One is dependent on money. Of one has only one commodity one *cannot* only
exchange it for money, but one *must* convert it to money. Commodity against
commodity does not work. The purpose of organising the social metabolism via
C-M-C contains both: Money as the master of commodities, which one needs to get,
in order to use it as a means for one’s needs and desires (which works because
money subordinates commodities).

> The price-form therefore implies the both the exchangeability of commodities
> for money and the necessity of exchanges. (198)

> The servant becomes the master. The mere underling becomes the god of
> commodities. (Contribution, Money Chapter)

Before in the analysis money becomes an end in itself, money is grounded as a
permanently present *simple* end in society. I want to emphasise what it means
when a “means” becomes an “end”.

Trivially this only means that whenever I choose a means for an ends then
obtaining that means (if available) becomes my temporary end. If for example a
state makes war in order to break the will of another sovereign, then it must be
its temporary purpose to destroy the source of the other sovereignty, i.e.,
destroy land and people. From that means no new ends do not arise permanently
for the warring state, because in times of peace it engages in negotiations and
chooses between acknowledging and breaking another sovereign. Just because
killing people is a means for governments, this does not imply that states have
to kill people from foreign states all the time. This is different if a means is
exclusive and without alternative as a means and this is the case with money. If
the access to use-values can only happen through money without alternative, then
every person who wants to satisfy his/her needs permanently must have the
purpose of getting his/her hands on money. This is a not unimportant political
economical argument, which Alice simply ignored: “One is dependent on
commodities, which can be converted into money.” No, “must” is the point
here. Because of the absoluteness of money it becomes necessarily a permanent
end.  Satisfaction of needs is only possible relative to this end, because there
is no choice, not even for capitalists.

*Charly*: Because money has the quality to be the universal means of access to
material wealth, but its quantity decides how much material wealth can be
accessed, it follows logically from money that one cannot have enough of it.

*Alice*: Not so easy. If this conclusion is reached so instant, this presupposes
that needs and desires are without boundaries and that is bourgeois
ideology. This ‘excess’ of money is btw. a very metaphysical reading of Capital.

*Charly*: Insofar the purpose of making money out of money includes making as
much money as possible.

*Alice*: If the conclusion above is not consistent, then here the same
applies. The infinity of needs and desires results from the competition, in
which no reached position guarantees the survival in future periods (Alice is
referring to relative surplus-value production here, introduced in Chapter
15). Only under these conditions we can consistently think the purpose to make
more money out of money. Also, only under these conditions it holds that more is
better than a little more.

*Bob*: On the one hand Alice is right, when she says that it is not follow that
simple from money, that one cannot have enough of it since there are examples,
where some people decide that they have enough. Not only rich people retire and
eat up their capital, also some workers retire voluntarily early because their
rent and savings suffice for them. One criterion for this decision can be for
both: relative to the stress and hustle, which earning money brings about, I
think that the money I have already suffices for a decent retirement. This is
btw. also something that Dave mentioned: such decisions exist and there people
relate their money and their claims on money with their needs and desires and
decide: this is enough.

The boundless purpose of money accumulation is thus imposed on everyone at any
given moment as a personal purpose (even though the personal purpose is
dependent on it, but more about this later). Presupposed is of course, that one
took care of earning money beforehand. But so far no boundless nature can be
detected.

On the other hand, Alice is wrong when she thinks competition has to be added to
moneymaking such hat the boundless nature of the purpose becomes valid. In the
passage of Capital, where the quality-quantity argument is made which Alice
labels metaphysical, Marx (C1, p.228) talks about the uncertainty of the selling
commodities to explain why everyone has to be a hoarder to some extend. He
talked about the variants of uncertainty before: The limits of the market for
the producers, turns the sell of a commodity into a salto mortale (C1, p.200ff):
is there demand for my commodity, and if so is it effective? What are my
colleagues doing? Are they producing a commodity which beats mine in quality and
replaces it? Are they producing faster and thus cheaper, such that I cannot
reproduce myself from my labour power? Or are we all getting faster, can produce
more and have to sell off our stuff really cheap which is beneficial for no one
of us? A few more uncertainties can be added to this: what about my suppliers,
are they increasing prices?  What about the stuff I want to buy, does that stuff
become more expensive? How come that one cannot rely on buyers, sellers and
fellow producers? Because they are concerned with their own business which means
“selling expensive” and “buying on the cheap”; which means attracting “effective
demand”. Why are they doing this? Because they want to earn money. And in the
same way, the person which has a problem with them. He acts in the same way and
causes uncertainties for the others. Thus even before the end “make *more*
money” one needs to note that the purpose “making money *at all** contains a
having and producing a lot of uncertainty.

The conflict is founded in the purpose “social access power” around which
everything circles necessarily. Money is the “possibility of all
use-values”. This verdict is not to be swallowed lightly, but it contains some
harshness. “Possibility of all use-values” contains a claim to power. The
possibility to have everything, contains the license to be ruthless towards
anybody who is dependent on these things as well.  Here the objective
relationship of interests/needs/desires is erased, such that these interests
oppose each other this way: if you have money you are something, if you have
none, you are out. “Thus the social power becomes the private power of private
persons.” (C1, p.230) To secure social power in the form of money contains an
antagonistic and exclusive interest of all economic subjects (not only the
concrete figures worker, capitalist and lawyer). That what I secure for myself
is uncertainty and subordination for others.

Competition is not added to money making but follows from the purpose to attract
“social power”. Thus not only capitals compete for money accumulation but it
applies to anyone who wants to earn money because he has to.

Because of the uncertainty which results from the purpose of earning money,
everybody must make hoarding an end, because the use of private access power for
consumption destroys this power [money is spent].  Separated from the permanent
purpose to use the means for reproduction one needs to gain money for the
worst-case scenario. And this worst-case scenario is quantitatively undefined
just like the quality of the of the means: earning money without loosing it in
consumption.

The quantity of the quality of the means is undetermined:

The means for the worst-case scenario, the social access power is undetermined
in its quality quantitatively undetermined. “Social access power” is taken on
its own quantitatively undetermined, because it is a totalitarian thing. For
comparison: “Every useful thing, for example, iron, aper, etc. may be looked at
from the two points of view of quality and quantity.” (125) Why does Marx say
this about use-values?  Because use-value is the property of a commodity which
is a relation between an object and a human need. Thus the quantity is
relevant. From 20 grams of wheat I cannot sustain myself. From 2 tons one can
bake bread for a couple of month or burn it to generate some amount of
energy. The quantitative side of the use-value is important, but does not have a
boundless nature in itself, because it is directly related to a human need or
desire, which as Alice pointed out is not infinite.  Money is for itself in its
quality a claim to power on the results of someone else’s labour (even when I
buy a pint for 3 quid, so not only for the capitalist). And as a claim to power
there is no boundary in money itself. This determination/quality of money has to
be appreciated on its own. Alice does not do that when she counters: Why, I can
relate the quantity of money to my needs and I can thus say after this and that
much money I have enough. Even if with this determination/quality of money it is
not explained why a person who is after satisfaction of needs and desires, has
the purpose to accumulate money without bounders, one has to characterise this
means first on its own/for itself.

The worst-case scenario is undetermined:

The immoderateness is because all people can only satisfy their needs through
money, are thus posited against each other and competition is the way this
antagonism is executed. This brings about uncertainty and thus one has to
prepare for the worst-case scenario. But this scenario is quantitatively
undetermined: a future illness (with the knowledge, that money can buy the best
medical care), the break down of earnings, change of flat, a car which breaks
down prematurely, etc. But of course money as social access power also raises
new needs & desires, which make the worst-case scenario even more
undetermined. I want to note that Marx brings the right argument for the
development of needs and desires which develop relative to the available
possibilities. With “social access power” new possibilities emerge: I can fund a
college education for my great-grandchildren. This is impossible in agricultural
subsistence. I can accept the offer from Russia and fly to the moon. I can eat a
Christmas dinner in New York for 10.000 Euro. I can own a flat in every
important capital of the world. I can try to help people in the Third World and
thus if I am Bono from U2 or Bill Gates I cannot have enough money because there
is so much poverty – just to counter the accusation that I want to spread only
negative judgements about the point of view of rich people. No they have
sometimes, often, maybe more often than workers, maybe less often than workers –
I don’t know and don’t want to measure it – that what commonly is referred to as
best intentions.

Both sides, precautionary and the new possibilities for needs and desires Marx
mentions, when he talks about the purpose of earning more money than needed for
immediate consumption:

> When the circulation of commodities first develops, there also develops the
> *necessity* and the *passionate desire* to hold fast to the product of the
> first metamorphosis. This product is the transformed shape of the commodity,
> or its gold chrysalis. (227)

Interim Conclusion: With my explications I want to have expressed that
competition follows from the simple purpose moneymaking and that the purpose of
accumulation follows from the purpose of simple moneymaking necessarily.

Accumulation as impersonal purpose of the capitalist economy:

The purpose “making *more* money” (regardless of as hoarder or as capitalist)
all economic subjects deny each other, because the simple purpose “make money
*at all*” is included in it – but in quantitatively exponentiated form – and the
purpose of attracting social access power contains an antagonism. Competition
thus does not follow from the purpose of making *more* money but from the
purpose making money *at all*. In the exponentiated content “*more* moneymaking”
all economic subjects compete in exponentiated form, such that the content “more
money than needed for immediate consumption” becomes a means for itself: money
that is available is invested, in order to make more money, and thus it is
capital.. Eventually this content and the exponentiated competition escalates
itself to accumulation as a way of reinvesting the gain, in order to be able to
make a gain permanently (this is Chapter 23 and following). This way the
capitalist purpose of this society, accumulation of capital, boundless increase
of value is executed “through the subjects” and detaches itself from their
personal arbitrariness (impersonal domination). Even if this arbitrariness can
be witnessed for some capitalists, for example Reetsman (a well known German
capitalist) who exchanged his capital into money in order to fund antisemitism
research from the interest. He personally does not accumulate any more, but only
the companies which receive his money as loan capital from the bank. Value as
means of survival without alternative imposes “holding on to value against
consumption” on a social level, thus imposes “using value to get surplus-value”
and imposes “using surplus-value for the purpose of permanent surplus-value
creation” - this is the content of the first volume of Capital.

We still have to clarify the question why when not everybody permanently follows
the purpose to accumulate money the purpose of society still is this
accumulation. Before the afore-mentioned early pensioners and ex-capitalists
enjoy their retirement, they must have earned money or claims on money. In order
for them to exit their company, they are reliant on other capitalists who pay
them and continue with production.  Their rents have to be produced by future
wage labour or successful stock market operations. Also the stability of
currency depends on successful capitalist growth. Eve said correctly: „Even if
he retires with a certain size of heard, he does not exit competition but
remains dependent on it.“ But in order to relate this verdict to my prior
statements one needs to note the following: because the dropouts from the
purpose “money accumulation” live on the money they have, their purpose is
reliant on the continuous efforts by others for more money.  They live on the
existing social access power or claims on it and in this way of living the
antagonism to others is included. They are not only dependent on successful
capital accumulation but are also encouraging others simply by using money as a
means of living.

To clarify: impersonal domination does not mean that this society does not
include personal purposes. But these are not the reason and not the governing
principle of the capital mode of production.
