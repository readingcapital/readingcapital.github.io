## [Hans G. Ehrbar's Notes on Capital](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~ehrbar/akmc.htm) ##

A good re-translation (better than the Penguin translation) and *detailed notes*
on Volume&nbsp;1.

## [Kittens](http://antinational.org/en/publications) ##

> We claim that modern misery ultimately is the result of capitalism and the
> nation state. The purpose of this journal is to prove this claim by explaining
> manifestations such as those listed above. The ideological conclusions people
> draw from this world make matters worse. We therefore criticise especially
> those theories that blur or even idealise the conditions we are forced to live
> under – whatever the well-meaning intentions behind them. In other words, with
> this journal we aim to criticise those conditions which ensure that wine and
> cheese are not available to everyone and to criticise everyone who justifies
> this.

> Since we refer to Marx quite a bit, a few clarifications. Capitalism does not
> vanish by itself. Its crises are nothing but crises of its valorisation. On
> the other hand, the fact that it causes people harm is an inevitable part of
> its package in crisis and in boom. Modern democracies, where politicians
> generally care about nothing except the well-being of the country, are the
> adequate form of government for the capitalist mode of production. The
> emancipation of politics from individual capitalist enterprises is a necessary
> condition for the existence of general capitalist relations. Nation states are
> not capitalist players on the market – they rather make markets possible.

* ["Does capital always aim to suppress wages?"](http://antinational.org/en/wage-and-profit-rate)

  *profit rate* (chapter&nbsp;2 of Volume&nbsp;3) not the rate of surplus-value.

* ["Gentrification — the Economy of the Land and the Role of Politics"](http://antinational.org/en/gentrification-economy-land-and-role-politics)

* ["Bitcoin - Finally, fair money?"](http://antinational.org/en/bitcoin-finally-fair-money) explains that *money* presupposes the *process of exchange* (chapter 2 of Volume 1) which is characterised by antagonisms and requires state violence.

  materialism* (chapter&nbsp;32 of Volume&nbsp;1).

## [GegenStandpunkt](http://www.gegenstandpunkt.com/english/en_index.html) ##

> The Marxist critique of political economy, “scientific socialism,” explains
> how and why the social evils the whole world deplores — unemployment and
> neglect, lousy wages and poverty, violence and war — are not accidental
> malfunctions.  Rather, they are damned necessary given ‘our’ social system of
> private property; and given states that found their continued existence on the
> success of private enrichment, and compete with all their economic, political
> and military might against each other to acquire global, capitalistic wealth.
> Every article and book from GegenStandpunkt Publishers furnishes yet another
> proof.

## [Ruthless Criticism](http://www.ruthlesscriticism.com) ##

> For us, discussions are not an end in itself, but the means to clarify all
> questions of politics, economics and ideology, such as:
>
> * what do “our interests” really have to do with presidents and politicians
>  all over the world,
> * why is force the means of politics and why do we need to bless its purposes
>   at all,
> * how are wealth and poverty produced in the “centers” of imperialism and
> * to what extent is popular morality incorrect in propagating good reasons for
>  the ruling purposes of this world.
>
> We are not fans of discussions as mere occasions for contemplation or
> developing our own ideas; of accusing the economy and politics of failure, of
> neglecting their noble purposes and principles; of developing alternatives
> which are supposed to be practical because they accept the methods of state
> and capital; or of demanding tolerance and understanding, thus immunizing our
> opinions from criticism.
